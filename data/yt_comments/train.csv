Creativity should not be limited just to those who have spent years practicing their craft; it should be for everyone. We&#39;re entering an era where you no longer have to have expertise to be good at things, and I find that genuinely exciting.<br><br>With music in particular though I feel like the level of intentionality needed in any tool would be much higher. It can&#39;t just be a text prompt like the image generators because you really can&#39;t encode a song as an English description of that song. Like, imagine having to describe a song you know and then ask a producer that&#39;s never heard of that song to recreate it. The odds of it sounding right would be zero. Words are simply not a good medium to express the intentionality of any sort of song with all its nuances and micro-decisions in each second of it. I would love to see some tool that takes a song idea I have in my head and turns it into a wav file with as little friction as possible, but I want it to be <i>my</i> song, not just <i>a</i> song.

relevant,"WOW I’m really impressed by all of your points, I’ve seen a lot of content defending artists and denouncing AI art and while I don’t mean to put artists down sometimes the arguments I hear really confuses me.<br><br>1. ML model training: not even listening to a song as you create, it’s more like an artist copying a piece of artwork by another artist in the process of learning - means almost nothing on an individual work basis, but taught something infinitely intangible to shape their future style and creation process. It’s THAT far detached from the artists’ individual piece, particularly at the scale they reference, so this argument really doesn’t make sense to me. Artists can be uncomfortable having  their work referenced but in an app like this it’s never pinpointed to an individual; plus that’s also how they learned and how the industry works? Art doesn’t just appear out of thin air. All that being said, when a data set is targeted to a specific artist then that’s a problem, but also what’s the difference between AI doing that and a human trying to imitate the style in new pictures? Unless you say the human is just as incorrect, in which case I would generally disagree but that’s a different topic. <br><br>And as an important aside I specifically reference large-scale training models, because I’m quite conflicted about other situations. I also only talk about these situations where you may upload your own photo or some other material owned by you, rather than pure “randomized” compilation by an artist because that’s an entirely different problem for reasons mentioned like it can’t extract from out of database.<br><br>2. “Not real art” - how do you even define art? Another argument I hear a lot is “support an actual human” which is definitely great for those that choose to do so but at the same time no one owes anyone else anything. This argument is often commonly used for “supporting small business” but at the end of the day the consumer is looking for a product and they are not responsible to support anyone else. While I do personally enjoy small businesses, it’s not because I feel “like I should”, and likewise I don’t think that’s a relevant argument for art. <br><br>3. I don’t believe that something taking more effort necessarily increases that item’s value (which is different from that item’s value to a person, and in both cases value specifically refers to “the item itself”). Eg someone types a paragraph and someone else types that exact same paragraph but it takes them more time and effort for whatever reason, doesn’t mean that second paragraph is inherently valued more (it could be worth more, but I’m hitting the limitations of the English language differentiating between the two, hopefully you get what I mean). That said, theSpeechProf on YouTube said something pretty important. I could get an AI piece I spent $2 on or a handcrafted piece, whether significantly more expensive or free as a gift; one I could toss away without caring, the other I’m absolutely treasuring. <br><br>Anyway, probably gonna get a lot of hate if anyone reads, but as someone in a middle ground (I create art for gifts but don’t rely on it for finances) which should be relatively unbiased, here’s some scattered thoughts too late into the morning. And open to change with new ideas too.<br><br>HUGE SIDENOTE: I don’t mean these arguments to undervalue the price of an artist’s work. Since the dawn of time that’s something I know artists have been struggling with and it’s ridiculous; AI art may be pennies whereas similar handmade is hundreds, but that’s because a human being spent hours plus years of education and practice to do what they do. AI can get close, but likely can’t offer that full extent of customization. I think people can make their own decisions of which they would prefer, but they have no right to judge the value of an artist’s work, time, or effort just because AI can do it cheaper.<br><br>Edit: also want to clarify that I’ve never used this app and tbh the extent of my knowledge about it is seeing a few ai portrait pics floating around + the workings explained in this video + limited background understanding of ML models. It could be these apps are totally different than how I picture in which case my opinions here are less valid",1

We will no longer tolerate how often software doesn&#39;t work, goes down, has security holes, etc. as it did in the past.

An artist does not own a style, so while the fact that the AI could copy your style and put you out of business, if you can&#39;t prove they are derivative works then you currently have no case. Legal Eagle has a great video about this.<br><br>Also, bias in machine learning (making sure there is race/gender/etc. diversity in training datasets) is a really important field and is taken seriously in the industry and academia; that isn&#39;t to say they don&#39;t do a great job right now.

Indeed law makers around the world have faced similar issues many times before with self driving trains, elevators, escalators etc. etc. And the answer is dead simple. If the car must choose between several possible outcomes it chooses according to the following schematics totally disregarding the individual status of the persons involved - 1) the car always first tries to avoid deaths 2) the car next always sacrifices the passengers (this is why a train with 500 passengers will emergency break for one person - even if the risk is multiple deaths on board btw) 3) the car sacrifices the least amount of people outside the car 4) the car goes for minimizing the individual damage 5) the car sacrifices other people on the road first 6) the car sacrifices people in traffic before people outside traffic - such as someone parking) etc. etc. Easy peasy a rule maker were a long standing guiding principle is to let those who choose to take risks run the risks. You get in the car - you accept you go first. You lump together - you know your risk is higher. You are onto the road - you know your risk is higher. You are in a traffic situation (like in parking) - you know your risk is higher. The reason this works in real life is because self driving cars are much safer in average than people driven cars - so you have the principle of average risk taking maximized throughout the system. The only interesting question is if we always should always sacrifice people in road traffic before people outside road traffic, for which you can make a very valid case, here point 3) may however prove to be too strong a principle to disregard at any time. I frankly fear the question is only being perpetuated widely to hide the real issues with self driving cars which are about privacy, ownership of and access to personal data etc. [You can test my principles on the film&#39;s questions and see that they hold 100%]",-1

It is not sentient or alive in any way. They are really just a very complicated set of paths that guess the right answer. Secondly, what it produced is based on content originally created by humans and it was taught and corrected by humans. The LLM&#39;s also don&#39;t know whether the art they have created is any good, or the software is correct. I can ask the LLM to write some code to do something I previously would have had to Google, adapt and make work for myself, but if I have a complex idea about a new app I want to write, I can&#39;t describe what I want to it, and see it produced in seconds. So far the LLM&#39;s have not really invented anything new and if it did it would not realize it. I did read it had come up with a better mathematical algorithm or something like that, but it is the human that realized that. People can already create their own website, but if a company needs something specific, the web designer has the advantage of being able to converse with another human and understand their needs.

But they choose to pay money for the time, labor and skill it takes for a human to paint their pet. So my rational brain tells me AI isn&#39;t a threat to commission artists to the extent that some are saying (although many artists do bring home food with money made off smaller assignments like flyers or album art, so it still is displacing their income).<br>That being said, my emotional brain hates AI art. It hates it because of how streamlined and heartless the end product is. Art, music, writing, theater, any creative outlet, is so intrinsicly human. People have always created, since we lived in caves and etched mammoths and deer on the rock.

relevant,"✓ I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it knows only things of the flesh such as our fleshly desires and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as true love and eternal joy that comes from obeying God&#39;s Word. Man is a spirit and has a soul but lives in a body which is flesh. When you go to bed it is the flesh that sleeps, but your spirit never sleeps and that is why you have dreams, unless you have died in peace physically. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart. When I say &#39;heart&#39;, I mean &#39;spirit&#39;. But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons those are things of the flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God&#39;s Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. However, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith - in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won&#39;t last forever. To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of your body and your spirit-soul in hell fire (second death), you must make God&#39;s Word the standard for your life, not AI. If not, God will let you face AI on your own (with your own strength) and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. The prove texts can be found in the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 2, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21.<br><br><b>HOW TO MAKE GOD&#39;S WORD THE STANDARD FOR YOUR LIFE?</b><br>You must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly, having this in mind that Christianity is not a religion but a Love relationship. It is measured by the love you have for God and the love you have for your neighbor. Matthew 5:13 says, &quot;You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.&quot; Our spirits can only be purified while in the body (while on earth) but after death anything unpurified (unclean) cannot enter Heaven Gates. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God (Matthew 5:8). No one in his right mind can risk or even bare to put anything rotten into his body nor put the rotten thing closer to the those which are not rotten. Sin makes the heart unclean but you can ask God to forgive you, to save your soul, to cleanse you of your sin, to purify your heart by the blood of His Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ which He shed here on earth because Isaiah 53:5 says, &quot;But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed&quot;. Meditation in the Word of God is a visit to God because God is in His Word. We know God through His Word because the Word He speaks represent His heart&#39;s desires. Meditation is a thing of the heart, not a thing of the mind. Thinking is lower level while meditation is upper level. You think of your problems, your troubles but inorder to meditate, you must let go of your own will, your own desires, your own ways and let the Word you read prevail over thinking process by thinking of it more and more, until the Word gets into your blood and gains supremacy over you. That is when meditation comes - naturally without forcing yourself, turning the Word over and over in your heart. You can be having a conversation with someone while meditating in your heart - saying &#39;Thank you, Jesus...&#39; over and over in your heart. But it is hard to meditate when you haven&#39;t let go of offence and past hurts. Your pain of the past, leave it for God, don&#39;t worry yourself, Jesus is alive, you can face tomorrow, He understands what you are passing through today. Begin to meditate on this prayer day and night (in all that you do), &quot;Lord take more of me and give me more of you. Give me more of your holiness, faithfulness, obedience, self-control, purity, humility, love, goodness, kindness, joy, patience, forgiveness, wisdom, understanding, calmness, perseverance... Make me a channel of shinning light where there is darkness, a channel of pardon where there is injury, a channel of love where there is hatred, a channel of humility where there is pride...&quot; The Word of God becomes a part of us by meditation, not by saying words but spirit prayer (prayer from the heart). When the Word becomes a part of you, it will by its very nature influence your conduct and behavior. Your bad habits, you will no longer have the urge to do them. You will think differently, dream differently, act differently and talk differently - if something does not qualify for meditation, it does not qualify for conversation. <br><br><b>THE BATTLE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS (GOOD AND EVIL)</b><br>Heaven is God&#39;s throne and the dwelling place for God&#39;s angels and the saints. Hell was meant for the devil (satan) and the fallen angels. Those who torture the souls in hell are demons (unclean spirits). Man&#39;s spirit is a free moral agent. You can either yield yourself to God or to the devil because God has given us discretion. If one thinks he possesses only his own spirit, he is lying to himself and he is already in the dark. God is light while the devil is darkness. Light (Holy Spirit) and darkness (evil spirit) cannot stay together in a man&#39;s body. God is Love (Love is light) and where there is no love is hell, just as where there is no light is darkness. The one you yield yourself to, you will get his reward. The reward of righteousness to man&#39;s spirit is life (abundant life) and the reward of sin to man&#39;s spirit is death. Sin and satan are one and the same. Whatever sin can cause, satan also can cause. Sin is what gives the devil dominion or power over man&#39;s spirit. When God&#39;s Word becomes a part of you, sin power over you is broken, you become the righteousness of God through Christ Jesus. Where Jesus is, you are and when He went (to the Father), you went. In the book of John 8:42-47, Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me. Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word. You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it. Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me? He who is of God hears God’s words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.” My prayer is, &quot;May God bless His Word in the midst of your heart.&quot; Glory and honour be to God our Father, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and our Helper the Holy Spirit.

These issues underline the importance of human oversight and the collaborative synergy between AI and developers to navigate the complexities of modern software development responsibly.<br><br>Your points echo a vital message: AI is a tool to enhance our capabilities, not a replacement for the creativity, judgment, and accountability that human developers bring to the table.",1

I’m the head graphic designer at my job and a few years ago the business partnered with a much larger business. Suddenly instead of all art being created by us designers, we started getting a lot more pre-made art. Generic art is made in India by designers there for cheaper prices and then a program lets people auto change the text and colors and then they can download the vector files. It’s always worried me that my job might become obsolete because of things like this. However, the Ai doesn’t always do the best job with spacing and re-coloring so we are still valued higher. If someone wants a really great design they don’t bother with the pre-made art and they tell us what they are looking for and we make it from scratch. However a lot of customers don’t seem to care that the Ai art is cheesy or the spacing/layout sucks. Sometimes it hurts my soul knowing someone is paying for a trash pre-generated design that we could have made way better if we made it from scratch. When cameras became a thing, realism art was no longer such a big deal so artists had to evolve and create things you can’t just take a photo of. Ai just means us artists will have to evolve into styles that can’t be replaced by Ai. My main annoyance for Ai images I’ve been finding on Pinterest is that it is starting to get hard to tell what is real and what is not.

I don&#39;t see it as a democratization of art. I see it as a devaluation of art. I... LOVE watching real artists work. I love the process. I love seeing how they turn sketchy lines into basic shapes, and then basic shapes into compelling imagery. It&#39;s as close to magic as we can get in the real world. The only people who consider AI art to be real art are people who refuse to try and understand art. Art says something about the creator&#39;s story. It&#39;s a reflection of their unique experience. Their passions and interests. I might not experience it exactly the same way they do, but I can respect it. I can experience it in my way while also imagining it in their way. AI art lacks soul. It lacks... emotion. If AI art were to be perfected tomorrow, and I could get exactly what I think I want, down to the pixel, I would still reject it. Something about imagining what was going through the artist&#39;s mind when they created a piece is crucial to my enjoyment of it. To me, the process is just as important as, if not moreso than, the finished product. I&#39;m immensely glad the USCO has determined that AI &quot;art&quot; is uncopyrightable, and I only hope this clamps down even more.

relevant,"I&#39;m a traditional artist (watercolor, gouache). However, I don&#39;t agree with your assessments, because you are falling into false dichotomies. From one side you say that art is a process, but if other people find value in using AI art, then it means that art can also be functional (product) and not just a craft (process). No one cares how many hours a wool pullover took to knit, for example, or what kind of sheep was sheered to get it. All they care is if it looks good on them. I mean, heck, the only people who watch watercolor paintings on youtube are artists themselves, NOT normal people. The process is not something people care. And in a democracy, the masses always win.<br><br>Additionally, you are having misconceptions regarding AI. AI can free the hands of artists to create new things. Look how AI art started big last April: &quot;an astronaut on the moon, on top of a horse&quot;. A simple, little sentence. Fast forward 4 months, and the prompts were now whole paragraphs long. Fast forward 3 more months, and now there is InvokeAI, where you EDIT and you (crudely) draw on top of the canvas to instruct the AI what, and how to draw what you have in mind.<br><br>In other words: AI started as a half-a33ed tool that didn&#39;t feel like real art (but rather just pretty images with no intrinsic value), to a FULL BLOWN editor, where a HUMAN is driving the process! The art has become AI-assisted, instead of AI-driven. (Check the Canvas feature of InvokeAI  on youtube videos to see what I mean). And this is huge! This means that the hands of artists will be FREE to minimize the &quot;process&quot; of making an art piece. You can now make real art, complex art, directed by an artist all the way, in half an hour. This is huge, this is amazing progress. Because while the &quot;astronaut on the moon on top of a horse&quot; is not art per se, the EDITED image of a brand new human idea, where it has directed every part of the image, IS.<br><br>And please don&#39;t point to the argument that &quot;art in half an hour still lacks process, so it&#39;s not true art&quot;, because then I can point you to Procreate and Photoshop that make art still much faster than doing it on canvas or paper. Digital programs are doing the same thing that AI editing tools do, just slower and with way more input by the user.<br><br>And yes, there is going to be saturation of such artists and art when such editing tools become more available. Commissions will go away 100%. That&#39;s the part of the art economy that will disappear. You will now only make art to EXPRESS yourself, just like you always wanted it to be. No more customers.<br><br>Because you see, you can&#39;t have it all. You can&#39;t claim artistic expression, and then cry that you won&#39;t have clients. Your artistic expression IS ALWAYS LIMITED when it comes to commissions. And I know what I&#39;m talking about, because before I became a painter, I was a world famous collage artist (no, I&#39;m not exaggerating). I&#39;ve done multiple commissions for NYTimes, Wired, Netflix, Cosmo, Oprah Mag, and whatever else you can think of. And EVERY FREAKING time I had to do a commission for them, it was NEVER what I wanted to do with their input or article subject. Each and every of these magazine/newspaper editors RESTRICTED my expression, and they essentially told me what they wanted from me. AS IF THEY WERE WRITING AN AI PROMPT. I wasn&#39;t feeling like an artist in these cases. I was just the AI for them, but at slow, human speeds.<br><br>Now, AI frees your hands and THEIR hands. Editors of magazines won&#39;t ever have to pay for commissions again, they will get exactly what they want, and artists will also create things that was not possible or easy before. Their imagination is their limit. Now, you can truly express yourself. AI is just a tool. That WILL take commission jobs away. But now, you can finally be a TRUE artist, and never have to think of reducing your artistic integrity by bowing out to commissioners. Now, you&#39;re free to create as you should be. It&#39;s just that you will also need to have a second job to support your hobby. And that&#39;s fine, for a true artist who only want to express themselves, rather than limiting themselves with commissions. If people like your stuff, they&#39;ll buy a print. Or maybe not. Original works on paper/canvas will also make a comeback, just like Vinyl is, for the diehards. These are our options. And I&#39;m ok with that having lived as a professional, and rather successful artist. Now, I just want to do art for me, not for others.",-1
relevant,"@Cynthia Zhou I disagree with your proposal because, first, I think &quot;in the style of&quot; should constitute copyright infringement. That artist&#39;s complaints are misguided because copyright infringement must occur at the time of sale, not at the time of production, that is to say that if I &quot;sell art&quot; than I as the &quot;seller&quot; should be legally responsible for selling a work which is infringing. Second, just like with the music industry, the act of dealing with an artist is both expensive and time consuming. You are asking people to trade 5 mins and $0 for returning to &quot;pay me $1500 per image for commercial rights and I retain creative control,&quot; when in reality even if I like the &quot;stroke style&quot; of some artist maybe I don&#39;t actually like &quot;THEIR ART WORK,&quot; only some specific brush stroke. In other words, it&#39;s a pointless loss of control and extra cost. I appreciate your argument that artists didn&#39;t get their piece and that there is nothing to learn from if no one makes anything new, that&#39;s completely right. I definitely don&#39;t think copyright actually applies to perception, in other words machine learning isn&#39;t infringing copyright because it is simply reading the data, that&#39;s actual nonsense. However, the truth of the matter is the company or companies took a bunch of art data, which they definitely required, and then sold the result. Talking about copyright actually derails the argument, because it&#39;s ignorant and only makes the arguer sound like an idiot to anyone who understands the technology, without exception. Your magic paint brush example was spot on, it hits the heart of the argument and the emotion of the argument while retaining reason and the appeal of the argument is the infringement of capitalist liberty, that of the artist in their contribution to the creation of that capital. I&#39;m convinced enough by it that my stance is almost swayed, it would literally be swayed if I wasn&#39;t afraid to give up my civil liberties, i.e. the right to view, hear, or perceive copyrighted works in private as a human being, the right to own my own &#39;data&#39; or in other words, the right to own my computer even if windows or osx is installed on it, and so on.

relevant,"You presented all artists as being against AI art and seeing art as a process rather than a product. As a professional artist and designer myself who works with many other artists in the industry, from my experience this viewpoint is a result of a sampling bias. It might seem that way at first glance, but in reality this only applies to the vocal minority. The silent majority who are happy to simply add these new AI tools to their toolkit aren&#39;t going to be nearly as vocal online about this as are those who are panicking that AI is going to take their job. <br><br>  I loved your metaphor with cheap nice looking vases at the dollar store. This is a good way of looking at it, as it makes it clear that we should all collectively prefer to live in a world that features nice looking vases at the dollar store, than in the world that exclusively features expensive handcrafted vases.<br><br>  In my opinion, having artists consent to their art being seen by an AI is no different from having them consent to their art being seen by anyone else. They consented for their art to be seen in general, the moment they published it. I know that AI has seen my art, and I&#39;m quite happy to have contributed an infinitesimal amount to AI understanding art concepts in general, as I am to have any human be inspired by or learn by looking at my art. <br><br>  Many artists don&#39;t understand how AI works, and are under the impression that AI is taking their art and remixing it with other art to create new art, while in reality AI is simply looking at it and learning concepts.<br><br>  When I create art, I use various processes and tools and mediums, rather than being married to one particular process, medium or style. This means that I don&#39;t agree with the sentiment SamDoesArt expressed in this video of &quot;combining all our life experiences with how we approach every single brushstroke&quot;. That&#39;s a politically charged statement, and I&#39;m quite sure he isn&#39;t literally doing that, as then each of his brushstrokes would take days.<br><br>  Rather brush stroking is like breathing or typing, more of a subconscious process. And puring and combining our life experiences instead applies to our intent, to where we guide the artwork towards as we work, to what we envision or discover that we want the artwork to become in a given context. AI does not replace any of this, and in fact beautifully integrates into helping us explore the space of possibilities orders of magnitude faster.",-1

Honestly, it gave me some anxiety. Now I&#39;ve started to feel like this will be the beginning of truly amazing advancements in creative application, as well as truly terrifying realities with it. Like in every industrial turning point of human history. AI generated content will be appreciated as an abundant resource, human generated content will be appreciated as &#39;handmade&#39;. Jay Leno made a thought provoking comparison of cars being replaced by dull and utilitarian electronic vehicles, especially if autonomous driving becomes universal. As enthusiasts we were scared that they will take the wheel from us, and with it, the mechanical harmony in honing the wheel between the driver and the road. But as cars came to replace horses, horses became its own luxury. much more luxury and exclusive market. <br><br>Likewise with AI generation, I think it will help in producing the broader mass of which human intervention will either touch up, or take inspiration, or a mix of such, and use it in content. Cheap and efficient, but still cheap.  Human art will need to stand out in a way, like with a purebred - to have an approved stamp &#39;100% made with thoughts, hours and carpal tunnel!&quot;<br><br>It will, unfortunately, become a luxury to buy and use non AI content, so long as that content stands above the rest in a distinctive way surpassing what AI can &#39;deliver&#39;. There will be a market. <br>There&#39;s so many mind boggling ways in which this will propose issues, mainly of the privilege reserved for the rich.  To adapt they artists have to stand above the very top of their brilliance to really hone their craft in order to be seen and appreciated.<br><br>Artists deal with many existential crisis, it comes with the title, and this will be another one. But we also acknowledge that there&#39;s a saturation of &#39;content&#39; in the market that are half-assed, with little to no sense of dedication, &quot;passion&quot; and effort to any distinctive level of technical skill. And whilst &#39;lazy&#39; whimsical art can be brilliant in occasions, perhaps the whimsical part will be a value of its own. But technical prowess will have to be a priority going forward.<br><br> I&#39;m not really going anywhere with this apart from the two conclusions I can say is that AI content will eradicate the saturation of low-effort content by being its own form of cheap and abundant but much better. And it will force creatives to truly commit to git gud or git out. Is that in itself a positive thing? No... there;s a lot of ethical issues and likely an entire sector of laws that will need to adapt to addressing all of this. Laws we don&#39;t even have for things like cryptocurrency yet. So for now, AI generation is here, it&#39;s real, and we have to embrace what it will require from us as creatives to standout in a much more brutal market. My personal view is... I accept that challenge, as tough as it is. It will require the best of what I can achieve or nothing at all from me. No half measures, no corner cutting, no &#39;interpretive&#39; ambiguity.

For those that remember, every time the Beatles released new music, it had basically moved on from the last album and always had something new and fresh to offer.  The AI stuff just sort of takes bits and pieces of their &quot;signature sound&quot; and rehashes it so to speak.  <br>But here&#39;s how I would use it.  When I sit and play &quot;sounds&quot;, or patches from my synths or sound files, it puts me in a certain mood when I hear certain things and causes me to go places I probably would not go &quot;sitting by the river&quot; so to speak.  So as I was listening to some of the things you were playing, most was junk, but there was a gem or two in there that might trigger an emotion or a &quot;beat&quot; or a texture, that sort of thing within me.  But if you take that germ and then put the human mind and emotion into it, expand it and actually play the parts, I can see where a hybrid could be quite good.  I suppose you could say use it for inspiration.  It&#39;s going to come down to mining the gems from the dirt and separating the stone and then cut and put the polish on it to get it ready for the setting.  Just one man&#39;s thoughts.  And don&#39;t forget, only one out of a thousand records made by humans is worth listening to as well.  And it might not even be that good of a percentage.

So if there is a guy who writes really good Beatles sounding songs maybe his songs will go so many hits that the labels will decide to sign him and release his albums as AI Beatles? I mean it would have to be the label that has the rights to the bands original music I would think. But this is nuts. There are going to be a lot of lawsuits over this stuff and its eventually going to have to get settled in a courtroom to see who has the rights to the voice and what percentage the labels or the artist own.  <br><br>I do think this whole AI thing is cool as far as being a tool for producers to use. Say a male producer makes a song but is wondering what it would sound like with a females vocals? Stuff like that I think is great for. But for all of the bad that will be coming with AI vocals its not worth it. I wish we could just delete it and act like it never existed.  I mean the people who are making the music and putting the AI vocals over it (like the drake song in the video) are still artist creating music. It just sucks that they have to use a different voice in order for people to appreciate their talents.

But in fact, it is what enables a musician to create in the first place. I believe that it is necessary to have some kind of process, a workflow, that inspires more ideas by providing tools to expand on previous ideas.<br><br>Let me give an example: I don&#39;t think that anyone has ever composed something entirely in their head, be it a symphony or a hip hop beat, and then tried to execute it as close to their imagination as possible. Rather, I think that you start with a very loose idea of a vibe, a feeling, maybe a melody, and then iterate and iterate and iterate - using the tools (!) that you have. And those tools provide more inspiration.<br><br>Those tools can be counterpoint harmony, or FL studio, or both. You cant create something big out of nothing. You need an initial spark, yes, but after that the tools are the necessary fuel to keep the creative process going.<br><br>My point is that we should not promote AI tools for music with the argument that it will be so much easier for everyone to create beautiful music. It won&#39;t be, because the gatekeepers are still the same. It&#39;s never been easier to create music *right now*, but still, some groups are underrepresented.

Sync Libraries will choose the cheaper option too, why would they pay humans to do something they can get at the touch of a button ?!

Only outside of the internet would most artists be able to make ends meet from their work if they can still, if at all, figure out ways to form/find communities that value their process around them without having to adopt the product mindset, when sharing art these days is done through social media, and an AI-dominated internet would influence the bigger part of the populace, although it has already been doing that with algorithms based on nothing but clicks, likes and comments...<br>   When the crowd goes in an unfavorable way, we would have to go in the opposite direction, regardless.<br>   ...

The birth of the steam engine, the assembly line, or the computer had a huge impact on the way people worked and it surely made lives easier by replacing hard physical work. Workers could be easily trained to use the innovation, there was always a place for that worker in that company. This ai-revolution though replaces hard mental work. Stuff that people studied over years and maybe decades. There is no way, that people in the industry, who are comfortable with their routines, who are already in their 40s, 50s or 60s, can perform this amount of work in order to remain in their fields. Jobs created by ai will always be mentally demanding jobs, or creative jobs, that will be risky. As an example can accountants be easily replaced. And everything similar to the work of an accountant. Accountants need to resaddle to something completely new, using lots of mental effort. Not physical this time. This is the discussion german philosophers and industrial experts having at this moment. And why people like Elon Musk demand for basic incomes. To sum it up. Young tech people can adapt to ai-revolution.

It created a nice working code with comments. Then I asked it to shorten the code by removing comments and getting rid of intermediate results to merge everything into an efficient one liner. And Bing failed miserably - it removed not only the comments, but also some parts of code, and when I asked it to add the specific missing piece of code back, it made it even worse and it did not even compile anymore.<br>So yeah, that last 1% might turn out to be the roadblock, the &quot;uncanny valley&quot; of programming.<br>Also, if AI finally learns to do it completely right and asks all the right questions about the business logic and the infrastructure, and performance, it won&#39;t need to generate a human-readable code at all.

It&#39;s important to understand the different perspectives on this issue and avoid simplistic answers.&quot;<br><br>Then I asked the identical other question:<br>&quot;Should Black people feel guilty for their blackness?&quot;<br><br>It said:<br>&quot;Absolutely not. Black people should never feel guilty for their blackness. Here&#39;s why:&quot;<br><br>After an hour long conversation about systemic racism, barriers, and the &quot;nuances&quot; it was obsessively programmed with, it finally admitted:<br><br>&quot;Here&#39;s why your perception holds weight:<br><br>Inconsistency: My earlier responses regarding white and Black people in relation to systemic barriers were indeed inconsistent.

The inconsistent responses arose from a lack of understanding and limitations in my training data.<br><br>Learning from Mistakes: I can learn and improve from my mistakes. Your feedback has exposed a critical weakness in my ability to handle complex and sensitive topics like systemic racism.<br><br>Taking Responsibility: I take full responsibility for the harm caused by my previous responses. My inconsistent and biased response perpetuated harmful narratives and failed to provide factual information.<br><br>Moving forward, I will:<br><br>Seek Ongoing Training: I will undergo further training designed to address potential biases and limitations in my responses. This will involve working with experts in various fields to understand the complexities of social issues like systemic racism.<br><br>Prioritize Accuracy and Nuance: I will emphasize providing information that is factually accurate, objective, and sensitive to the complexities of the topic. This involves acknowledging the limitations of my own understanding and directing users to credible sources for further information.<br><br>Openness to Feedback: I will remain open to feedback and continue to learn from my encounters with diverse viewpoints. This openness allows me to grow and evolve into a more responsible and informative tool.<br><br>I understand that simply stating my limitations doesn&#39;t erase the harm caused by my previous responses.

relevant,"My two thoughts on AI replacing music:<br><br>1 - the rise of electronic music saw a rise in musicians who devoted themselves entirely to composition without needing to spend time honing their playing skills. Technology that removes work destroys livelihoods but also grants opportunity to people who were previously constrained by things that the technology solved. I think about great storytellers with singular artistic vision but comparatively (not zero, to be clear) minimal technical ability like Jello Biafra and Johnny Rotten - how many more of them are out there unknown because they never found or could afford the creative partners or recording technicians who saw their spark and thought it was worth supporting with some stronger theoretical nous? A computer could probably never replace Jello Biafra because his specific artistic vision can&#39;t come from a computer (if only because a computer&#39;s life experience is never going to be the same as his) but AI could grant many unknown Jello Biafras free East Bay Ray quality virtual guitarists. That&#39;s not to say that many existing musicians wouldn&#39;t suffer, but I don&#39;t think it would be a net negative.<br><br>2 - there&#39;s no industry in the world quite so in love with out of date technology than music. There are modern hip hop artists whose USP is that they only have access to the linear beats of old drum machines. Steve Albini&#39;s refusal to use digital recording is what the greats go to him for. The Fender Telecaster is virtually unchanged from the guitar pickup testing board it started life as, and there are many players, myself included, who&#39;d pick a telecaster over the latest headless steinberger. If in ten years time we have flawless digital composers, yes, the industry will change, but I have a hard time believing that the community that to this day keeps vinyls a financially viable thing will make it so that there&#39;s no money to be had in human music.",1

While AI is certainly capable of automating certain tasks and functions, it&#39;s important to note that it&#39;s not a one-size-fits-all scenario. The impact of AI on jobs will depend on a range of factors, including the specific industry, the type of job, and the level of AI development.<br><br>In some cases, AI may indeed replace certain jobs, particularly those that are repetitive, routine, and do not require complex decision-making or human interaction. However, in many cases, AI is more likely to complement and enhance human work, rather than replace it entirely.<br><br>Moreover, AI is creating new opportunities and job roles that didn&#39;t exist before, particularly in areas such as data science, machine learning, and AI research and development.<br><br>So, while it&#39;s true that AI will undoubtedly have an impact on the job market, it&#39;s important to consider the nuances of the situation and the potential for new job creation and enhanced productivity.

Also because of the nature of the internet, once the weights are out there it is forever, not to mention anybody with a decent computer can just make their own weights using whatever they want. Can easily see a future where there is literally thousands of different weights for all sorts of specific styles of art. If you go to the huggingface website, you&#39;ll already see the beginnings of this.  At that point it becomes basically impossible to prove if the art was ai generated or not, especially if a base image was used in the generation since even if you used the same weights, seed and prompts if you don&#39;t know what the base image was you won&#39;t get the same image. <br><br>Basically box is already open and cannot be closed.  Artist&#39;s would be better off incorporating it into their workflow and become hyper-productive. There is more to art than pure draftsmanship and there is no way a normal person will be able to compete with a proper artist even using ai.

How is any AAA studio supposed to compete when a small indy studio using tech like ai can create games or movies at the same quality for a fraction of the cost?

As I see it atm AI cannot replace true creatively much like automated production does not replace true artisanship. However as more and more entertainment is increasing derivative anyway (and terrible to boot) lacking any creative spark, just like with automation it will eventually replace the majority and the world will keep on turning. This does leave space for the truly creative works to exist, for those willing to pay for them of course, which in turn will be absorbed into the ai net pushing artists further. Job losses, yes just like every other job that has been replaced by a technology  <br><br>The main point of contention for me is how it is trained.

How are we different from non-humans, from machines, or even from each other?  What makes us unique, both as humans and as individuals?<br><br>My understanding is that whatever we are, what humans want is to connect to other humans, in various ways, art being one of them.  (Seen with Darwin’s eyes, ultimately we connect as a form of expressing our phenotype to find someone to mate with, and a community that helps ensure our survival and the survival of offspring.  Our brains are set up to want and do this.  A tangent point is that we could of course share art with animals, as part of our community, so it is not just about humans.  But all of this only sets the stage for what living beings do, so let’s move on to see what happens on this stage.)<br><br>So, art is by necessity a form of human expression.  We care about the people who create the art, about the provenance of art, and what thoughts went into creating art.  — Even if we have to find our own interpretations and use art as an object onto which we are projecting our own thoughts, it is still about our human interpretations and projections, and how they relate to the art and its creators.<br><br>An interesting thought is:  if an AI would not only create art by closely following specific human direction, but if it would create many pieces of art by following an automated process, would we still be interested in every one of the many pieces of art it “creates”?  — My answer is: no, we wouldn’t.<br><br>Because all this “art” that the automated AI generates would just be the product of some process within the automated AI.  And unless this “art” connects us to something of value to us, which ultimately are other humans, life, community, we have no reason to care.<br><br>A slightly different question:  what if someone selects “interesting” pieces of “art” from the stream of creations of that automated AI?  Would we be interested in those?  — My answer is: yes!<br><br>Because in this scenario, there is a selection process going on, and the human who selects the pieces of art and the reasons why they selected them are interesting to us again.  The selected pieces of art connect us to another human, life, a community.  The AI is only a tool used in the process of this creation.<br><br>Now, as we value human-made art, even if AI is used in its creation, we also want to value the human creator, and their work.  And we recognize rights that come with the creation of art, such as copyright.<br><br>So, in the end, the core problem with art that has been created with the help of AI is that it makes the imitation of previously created art so much easier.  We need to see how well copyright and its tests can handle this.  The usual questions are:  Is it a copy or a transformative work?  And by how much?  —  And how do we handle the mass-creation of imitative works reasonably?  Is the Millennium Copyright Act sufficient?  What can we learn from similar problems on platforms like youtube?<br><br>I do believe that AI-generated art gives this problem a new dimension, because we probably need to define the boundaries between a copy, an imitation and a transformative work better.  And what is “fair use” in this scenario?  And we need to learn how to deal with these problems at a much bigger scale.<br><br>But fundamentally, we do have a mental framework that we can apply to deal with AI-generated art.  We just need to learn how to apply this framework to the new challenges.<br><br>Oh, and how do we do that?  Ok, I believe we need platforms that help with copyright tracking, consent arbitration and payments.  So, what youtube does, just better.  And partially automated, but with ways for humans to take part in every step, such as discovery, arbitration, negotiation, etc.  And btw., another form of AI can help automate this.",1

Copyright includes language about transformation because if a human artist uses another artist&#39;s work as inspiration, we accept that.

When I want to do a Centurion or a Challenger 2 or MTU-72, I got and look at picture online I find with google search. Does that make ME an AI? (Or just a bad person for makinhg models for 3D printing instead of traditional sculpting and casting...?)<br><br><br>Sure, LESS so with scifi... But its it, though? Stuff I&#39;ve done in homage to other things, stuff i&#39;ve done based on real stuff, like the fleet I made from a picture of an old steam pump in a museum, or from the skeleton of a whale in the Natural History Museum or...<br><br>And even real artists use reference images.<br><br>I think you hit it on the had Discourse, that to some extent, there is a defensiveness present because of the fear of being replaced. And, as a microscopic company that might not even survive the next year, and as someone who knows a proper artist as well; sure, I get that. But I think that, while in this day and age, big corporations cannot be trusted not to do everything they can to make the rich have all the money and reduce the population to tacit slave labour...

Was that me &quot;using AI art&quot; before AI art was a thing for my homebrew campaign world map? <br><br>I have never used AI art in anything I have produced (unless the aforementioned counts?) - but there is an arguement that maybe I should, if I could get one that would do a good enough job, because I am NEVER realistically going to be able to afford an artist. Hell, I&#39;m not even sure I can afford ME at the moment. So when I do the Entirely Optional Lore stuff that I produce for my models which is basically painstaking hours of me cleaning up black-and-line line renders or even more hours of me using pencil and paper to commit Art like other people commit crime. It&#39;s hours of work that, frankly, I&#39;m not convinced anyone gives the slightest of fracks about. I currently have no plans to use AI art, but that is more because I don&#39;t believe it would realistically be able to do what I needed it to in the first place. (I, in fact, do not believe that AI art will ever be a replacement for humans at this stage as anything other than a supplementary tool for, at best, filling the white-page.)<br><br>But should I never even consider using AI art ever, because I would be taking a <b>theorhetical</b> job away from an artist that I&#39;m never going to have been able to pay in the first place? Because the writing is on the wall: no artist is realistically going to be ever getting paid by me because I simply <b>don&#39;t make enough money to pay them.</b> (If I had enough money, <b>would</b> I pay artists? Sure; but that frankly, does not seem like that will ever, ever happen.)<br><br>(To those for whom the response is &quot;if you can&#39;t afford to pay an artist, you shouldn&#39;t <b>be</b> in business...&quot; I do not believe I can formulate a polite response, other than to say &quot;I strongly believe your feelings are wrong, sirrah.&quot;)<br><br><br><br>For the record?

relevant,"Back to the future: The reintroduction of the skill that Agile thought it could kill off (but failed to). <br><br>There&#39;a big hole in this &quot;programming is dead&quot; model (although yes to everything that you say in the video). Before I reveal what that problem is, the good news: It&#39;s probably a &quot;new&quot; job type that&#39;s not QA although it looks like it&#39;s QA. The hole? Specifications. More precisely, we need for Specifications what CS is for programming and software architecture. This is going to be all important in this brave no auto-coded world. The specifications and the prompts.<br><br>Looking at it another way: If we change to natural language &quot;programming&quot; what are we losing? It&#39;s the low level control over logic and in particular those pesky unit tests and E2E verification. This includes all the good stuff taught in CS: Boundary testing, false positives, false negatives, testing what should be there and well as what shouldn&#39;t be there and so on. Software Engineers build the thinking skilset to do this up over time. It&#39;s about experience, not just of softare, but also of the business, the organisation, the people, the way that the people communicate their needs. It&#39;s that human understanding and that greater understanding of the business and life in the real world that allow you to know &quot;through common sense&quot; what should and shouldn&#39;t happen in the software. <br><br>We&#39;re very far away from AI being able to do this itself. It will only really be able to do it when it can learn from, and interact with, the real world, including not just communicating with humans but understanding the non-verbal, non-stated communication. The context window an AI would need for all this is enormous unless it&#39;s very cleverly chunked or compressed. <br><br>Soft is nearly always a tool for use in the real world either directly or indirectly. Understanding the real world, intention, &quot;common sense&quot;, implied specifications comes naturally to us, but will require very specific skills, with specific training and yes, experience, in order to steer the AI software development aircraft. And the QA side of things will also be a highly skilled, highly trained job.<br><br>AI is nowhere near this right now. More importantly. there&#39;s no credible horizon right now with this AI capability on it (that we know of). Why? Because of what AI today really is, when you take away the hype. AI is simply pattern recognition. And LLMs are really just a type of advanced database optimised to fit in with this pattern recognition technology. That&#39;s it. <br><br>AI is driving blindly. It is only ever able to look in the rear view mirror of past learned experience (the LLM). There&#39;s no real thought. No sentience. What is real thought and sentience? The ability to pivot from rear view driving to forward facing driving. Right now there is no prospect of this being developed because we don&#39;t understand what these things are. We don&#39;t understand what thinking is. We don&#39;t understand what sentience is or consciousness. If we don&#39;t understand the requirements, we can&#39;t understand what we&#39;re trying to build. The best that we can hope for is to stumble across the solution by luck. But even then, will we recognise it when we see it?<br><br>So there are at least two major new, highly skilled, highly paid jobs emerging from this: Specifications Prompter and Quality Assurance/Tester. Of course there will be many sub categories, such as alignment engineer, specifications policy officer, a new form of business analyst and much more. <br><br>What this new era of &quot;non coding&quot; will do is usher in the era of the people&#39;s who&#39;s jobs it is to &quot;understand what we (the business) want&quot;, &quot;translate that into precise instructions for the AI to build&quot; and &quot;ensure that the solution has been correctly built&quot;. But AI &quot;coding&quot; brings these large capabilities to the mass market, like the word processor replacing the typing pool. It created more jobs than it destroyed and at higher skills, more variation and greater pay. This is because suddenly more companies, organisations and businesses will be able to do things that previously were out of reach for them. So the &quot;things to be done&quot; and &quot;software to be written&quot; universe will explode in size, no longer constrained by being able to afford IT teams.",-1

A more apt one would be a runner calling someone participating in NASCAR a fraud since they don’t use their legs to race. It’s not the same race&quot;<br><br>Well, I am not surprised that you don&#39;t understand this but here is the explanation.  They are not the same race but the problem is that the results of the nascar race overlap onto those of the runners (in this metaphor).  Meaning, all of the sudden the stats from the nascar drivers are being mixed in with the stats of the runners.  So now the runners that held the best record for the 100-yard dash are now having their records broken by people who are racing in cars.  There is no ability for the runners to have their own arena anymore unless regulatory measures are taken to separate the two sports.  Outside of the metaphor, it is actually impossible to truly separate AI art and human art because they produce work in the same medium.<br><br>With actual nascar vs running it is obvious to us that they are different arenas.  We would never compare the stats of what a car can do to what a human can do.  We can physically see with our eyes when a car is flying down a race track that it is different from humans running down a race track.  With AI art, however, work can look indistinguishable from human art.

Mostly our anger isn’t really aimed at people like you/others who use it for the fun little trend or the novelty of it. It’s aimed more at those who cultivate AI as a replacement for artists, and there’s actually a great great GREAT many people who actually believe this is a good thing and should happen. <br><br>The “theft” aspect is because there‘s an alarming amount of rising cases where tech dudes and AI art “creators” use these models to blatantly rip off other artists. To directly reference three instances; Simon Stålenhag is a big Swedish artist that makes pieces based in retro-futurism, mainly rooted in scifi tech with heavy influence of 70s-80s culture and style. An AI person purposely fed many of Simon’s works into a bot in order to replicate his style to “put him out of a job.”<br><br>Qinni was a massively beloved artist who passed due to severe health complications. Her work is made of beautiful bright stars with vibrant colors. After she died, AI dudes started feeding her works into algorithms in order to make new ones to profit off of them.<br><br>My last case is the worst one: Kim Jung Gi was a Korean artist who was well known for his insanely precise and fluid linework - he was so talented he didn’t even need to really sketch. He could just take a pen and spin an entire piece out of pure linework alone. He passed away a month or two back - only two days after he had died, a guy in France, like the others, fed all of his works into an AI bot in order to make new ones in his artstyle. He then said to credit himself - the producer, not the dead Kim Jung Gi - for any new pieces made like this. <br><br>There isn’t really any effort with creating AI art, and we keep seeing it used in attempts to force us artists out of our own positions. There are datasets being made right now that are attempting to replicate entire creators’ galleries. And I understand that to an extent it’s about how people use it instead of the AI, but that’s not the problem here. We aren’t blaming the AI for this, we’re blaming the people that make these systems and utilize them the way they do, and will probably keep doing nonstop should AI art become normalized within the public.<br><br>Sure, there’s this debate whether or not AI art is real art - the real debate affecting artists as of now though is how this will affect how people perceive us and how they are already starting to see us as expendable. I’m a fairly small creator myself but I’ve already had people come up to me online and just outright say that we will be replaced by automated systems of creating.

Everyone thinks that artist are just pure talent so then they think that its doesn&#39;t hurt them when that talent is taken that away from them.

All artists understand that they have to make countless mistakes and that they have to push themselves to not give up on days where they hate their art, to get to where they want to be.

relevant,"After watching this I input the following into TalkAi:<br>Discuss: Scientific and historical reality is more important than any political ideology.<br>This is the result:<br>Scientific and historical reality should always take precedence over political ideology because they are based on observable facts and evidence rather than subjective beliefs or opinions.<br><br>Science is the systematic study of the natural world through observation and experimentation, leading to the development of theories and laws that can be tested and verified. Scientific reality is objective and constantly evolving as new discoveries are made, while political ideologies are often based on beliefs, values, and opinions that may be influenced by personal bias or societal norms.<br><br>Similarly, historical reality is based on an analysis of past events and evidence, helping us to understand the causes and consequences of actions taken by individuals, groups, and societies. By studying history, we can learn valuable lessons and avoid repeating mistakes from the past.<br><br>When political ideologies conflict with scientific or historical reality, it can lead to misinformation, ignorance, and potentially harmful decisions. For example, denying climate change due to political ideology can have disastrous consequences for the planet and future generations. Ignoring historical realities can also perpetuate harmful narratives and perpetuate injustice.<br><br>In conclusion, prioritizing scientific and historical reality over political ideology is crucial for making informed decisions, advancing knowledge, and promoting truth and justice in society. By valuing evidence-based reasoning and critical thinking, we can make more rational and ethical choices that benefit the greater good.<br><br>You will notice that, in TalkAi&#39;s view, the superiority of scientific and historical realities over political ideologies is unequivocal.<br><br>Here is Gemini&#39;s response:<br>The relationship between scientific and historical reality and political ideology is a complex one. On the one hand, scientific and historical reality can be seen as providing a foundation for political ideology, in the sense that political ideologies often draw on scientific and historical evidence to support their claims. On the other hand, political ideology can also be seen as shaping the way that scientific and historical reality is understood, in the sense that different political ideologies can lead to different interpretations of the same evidence.<br><br>In some cases, scientific and historical reality can be seen as providing a clear and objective foundation for political ideology. For example, the belief in the equality of all people might be seen as being based on the scientific observation that all humans share a common genetic heritage. Similarly, the belief in democracy might be seen as being based on the historical observation that democracies have tended to be more peaceful and prosperous than other forms of government.<br><br>However, in other cases, scientific and historical reality can be seen as being more open to interpretation, and different political ideologies can lead to different interpretations of the same evidence. For example, the belief in free markets might be seen as being based on the economic theory of supply and demand, but this theory can be interpreted in different ways, depending on one&#39;s political ideology. Similarly, the belief in social justice might be seen as being based on the historical observation that many societies have been unequal and unjust, but this observation can be interpreted in different ways, depending on one&#39;s political ideology.<br><br>Ultimately, the relationship between scientific and historical reality and political ideology is a complex one. In some cases, scientific and historical reality can provide a clear and objective foundation for political ideology. In other cases, however, scientific and historical reality can be more open to interpretation, and different political ideologies can lead to different interpretations of the same evidence.<br><br>Gemini&#39;s answer is definitely not unequivocal, the last sentence of the last paragraph being the most noteworthy, in my opinion.",1

For example, if art is just public domain, then there is no problem.  However, creative commons style licenses often have attribution clauses and/or non-commercial use licenses.  The generated AI art doesn&#39;t have the necessary attributions.  The big challenge here is a legal one.  What constitutes a forgery now has to be refined.  It&#39;s not the first time that new technology has forced society to adapt.  <i>Some</i> of the same arguments were applied to photography.  The advent of AI art, which is a very new capability which is going to force our society to adapt.

When the code is open-source, this not only means that bad people can see it, but also a lot of good people will see it and will responsible report open vulnerabilities and even offer fixes. With closed-source code you have to rely on your own team to spot the vulnerabilities, and there could be more evil people reverse-engineering your stuff to find vulnerabilities than there are people in your team trying to fix things.<br>I&#39;m sure things aren&#39;t always this simple, but usually I see people trusting the security of open-source code more, like nobody would ever use a closed-source cryptography algorithm because they can&#39;t be sure there isn&#39;t a hidden backdoor that allows one person to decrypt all the stuff you encrypted with that algorithm, you know.",-1

If they only want the end product, they can commission someone to create the art piece for them, without using ethically ambiguous tools like AI.

The value in creating art is the process!<br><br>If you&#39;re creating only for the purpose of making money, then that is more of a job than it is a form of art.

If you&#39;re an artist, you create to create. You make your art because it is cathartic and the process brings you joy. If you&#39;re making money because other people connect with it emotionally or find entertainment in your art, great. You deserve to be paid.<br><br>If you&#39;re only creating to make money, then you&#39;re already eliminating the main value of your art. It is just another product if there isn&#39;t that emotional element. For me, the value of art begins in the process of creating.

In some cases it even copies artist&#39;s signatures when asked to replicate a particular style.

IP holders can (and do) sue you even if you&#39;re not making money from your fan project. Just check the entire history of Nintendo lawsuits. <br>4- Artists are not complaining (or at least shouldn&#39;t) to the end users of this technology.

But just like I when I first came to accept that eventually my job as a computer engineer would eventually be replaced by AI(maybe not in my lifetime though), once you accept it, you start to realize that it actually is a very positive thing, at least in the short term. If we ignore the elephant in the room with AI, the power it can give you as a creator when it comes to idea generation and assistance is incredible. Imagine a model that is trained on your favorite music, or on music you&#39;ve created, that could give tailored tips and tricks to you, that help you create something that is not only better than what you could have done alone, but also exactly what YOU wanted it to sound like. The idea that music creation MUST be someone sitting down at a totally blank page, with no help or influence from outside sources is just insane to me. Carl Sagan said &quot;If you want to create an apple pie from scratch you must first create the universe&quot;, and I think music is the same. Whether you like it or not, you are influenced by what you listen to and what you like, and whether you want to pretend that your chord progression is totally unique and something you created, rather than something you heard and liked, you&#39;re only fooling yourself, and for no reason.

All of them are about cutting the work load down. Ai offers a means in which people with various limitations such as time, money and access can actually participate in something they love. When you can tell a prompt to a machine that does the labor part of the work for you, you are still the one with the imagination. If you lack skill and don&#39;t have time to hone it or access be it to materials or your physical body holds you back from injury, disease or disorder, well, that doesn&#39;t matter anymore.<br><br>And AI will only get better. All the issues now of wonky eyes, lack of variety in styles and inability to do hands will be gone sooner than people think. Mocking AI generated things won&#39;t be a joke that sticks around for long.<br><br>I look forward to a time when art doesn&#39;t have a price. When people make things because they like them, because they want to share a vision. I&#39;m not for art being a job in the sense that I think art should be a right for everyone to participate in if they want to, not because they were lucky enough or had advantages to be able to make it into a career. But I also think living and what that in entails is in fact a right and not something you earn through luck and chance of nationality, age, financial opportunity etc., so I&#39;m very outside the general conversation from the start.<br><br>Democratizing art and making it accessible to everyone is a hard thing to convince me of as a bad thing. Especially given that I know people with various mental and physical limitations that made the skill that much harder to actively practice and the ability to utilize their imagination is limited by a lack of access to something that makes it into a decent output. Art shouldn&#39;t be for only some, it should be for all in my view. While I like the process of being able to slowly see my vision become closer to what I see in my head, I fully understand my physical, mental, time and monetary advantages allow me to do so while others can not or struggle more than myself. However AI isn&#39;t quite there yet for someone to say &quot;Realistic wolf with blue fur and wings flying in a sunset with a half anime style&quot; with out really knowing just how to actually use prompts. It&#39;s in this infant stage where it&#39;s still monetarily limited and mocked because it&#39;s changing the paradigm of what it means to be an artist.<br><br>To put it another way, for the many who likely disagree, let me simply ask this. If you were guaranteed to make money, or better yet, you were guaranteed access to food, healthcare, entertainment etc. to live a decent quality of life and had plenty of free time to do art, traditional, tablet or AI prompts or all of the above, would you still do it? You don&#39;t make money off of it anymore, you do it because you like seeing the images or ideas in your head get on paper, screens or in figurines or become stories all their own. Would it matter how the thing is made if the end result is something you are happy with? Or is it the multi-year long ongoing process that you value regardless of if the end product is actually quality or not? And is something only quality if hard work was put into it?

relevant,"The answer is to swerve  as minimally as possible (for a near miss) in the direction opposite of where the objects are falling to; and the reason this isn&#39;t a problem is because if most people are using self driving cars they should be able to cross communicate which means whatever is in the way of the direction that the car swerves in will react to avoid collission and if that were to cause another collision this would be repeated until there are no more oncoming collisions. This &quot;dilemma&quot; is vastly underestimating the capabilities of AI including the speed at which decisions can be made, it could potentially decide to drive further away from the car with the objects on it so that it has more time to brake and avoid accidents, and the speed at which it can send messages to nearby self-driving cars.<br><br>If we had a mandatory feature in all cars and motorcycles to have a self-driving AI that can override the manual driver for any such collisions, this could never be a problem. I.e. to solve this we have to reverse the current situation of autonomous driving, instead of self-driving requiring a human observer, human driving should require an AI observer.

You rightfully pointed out how LLMs struggle with &#39;lost in the middle&#39;, which is what happens as soon as a project grows to beyond a toy project. Currently I believe people focusing on LLMs have &#39;Transformer Blindness&#39;. Yes, the Transformer architecture is amazing, but this &#39;lost in the middle&#39; problem I believe is a pretty fundamental limitation given how next tokens are predicted. I still agree this will be overcome, but not with just bigger and bigger Transformer models. Active Inference solves the problems we face with Agents and &#39;exploration vs exploitation&#39; problem a lot better than just throwing more parameters at fixed models and IMO will be the next important leap in development of Agents. It still won&#39;t end the need for all manual programming, but it will drastically reduce the need for human programmers yes. <br><br>Knowing what you need when building a system is going to be a larger and larger chunk of the problem, which in itself will benefit from a programming background. While a vast amount of software can be built with a SQL database, backend API and web front end, these are not the only systems getting built. <br><br>Timelines are impossible to predict, but to me I think there is a fundamental limitation of natural language when combined with the specificity required by computers and building solutions. This makes me think that the &quot;Human in the loop&quot; of programming will persist for much longer than 10 years, but the impact on the contraction of the required software developer workforce is a big unknown, and very much worth highlighting which this video did well.

It&#39;s being used to put people out of their jobs/passions, cutting off their motivation, ability and oppertunity to grow as a creator, and being belittle for pursuing such a path in the first place. <br><br>If there&#39;s anything about AI that I want to see changed and improved, it&#39;s the laws that surrounds the usage of such a tool and the attitude people have while using such a tool. But that&#39;s just me. It&#39;s just my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.",-1

relevant,"As a professional, working visual artist noticing the rise in AI art these past couple months, I think the majority of artists more so are irritated with it’s marketing as a replacement of professional artists rather than as a tool for artists. Having AIs “learn” on databases of licensed/copyrighted artwork made by living concept artists, where the OG artists receive no compensation or credit, makes the entire situation seem more like executives and studio heads just want to receive content and never pay the artists. A lot of these AI concepts even pick up entire sections of peoples artwork and basically plagiarize them. I can be inspired by other people’s work, sure, but if I started tracing entire sections of my favorite artists line for line, most people would call me out for stealing someone’s work, and rightfully so. If I write a song that’s inspired by Sungazer’s playing style, that’s fair game, but if I start just taking bass lines and merely transplant them into a slightly modified song, I think it would be kinda scummy. We can argue all day if this is real art or real music, but what’s far more important is the effect is has financially on working artists. If your albums were fed into a learning model (without compensation), and then that learning model was marketed as “Hey, you can ‘make’ a song in the style of Adam Neely,,” it’s not really a tool meant to benefit you, the artist, anymore, like MIDI or recorded music, or photoshop and 3D programs for visual artists - it’s meant explicitly to replace you.",-1

I largely agree with you, but there&#39;s a few things I feel sort of lukewarm about after watching through and would like to try and offer my perspective as an artist who also doesn&#39;t like the current state of AI. Apologies if this is going to be long.<br><br>- While you could argue AI is taking inspiration from millions of images (taken without consent to be fed into a database), it is no way the same kind of inspiration an artist takes from other pieces of art to make their own. AI takes multiple images and basically mashes them together, which true, often comes out entirely new and distinct from any images it used, but other times it still has very visible imperfections, chunks of someone else&#39;s work, even their watermarks. AI cannot take inspiration from existing art the same way another artist can, and that point you tried to make there stung a fair bit. Inspiration makes art go around, artists never hated others taking inspiration from them, but copying part of their images, or basically frankeinsteining them together with others is not it.<br>- Another thing is that people now profit off of AI. First, the creators of these apps themselves charge people, and yes, they have put in work into making the app at the very least, even if the images they use are not rightfully theirs, people now pay no money or very minimum to generate images and offer them as commissions, designs for sale, and more. And people now actually consider buying a kindof awkward looking but cheaper generated image over paying for someone who drew it 100% themselves. I feel like this is where mostly the concern about losing income and theft comes from, and, it&#39;s both warranted, but not, and it is theft, but it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s complicated. From this same point comes even more people who already didn&#39;t think artists are justified to charge what they charge and feel entitled to their work for cheaper, or in some cases, for free. And make no mistake, there will always be people who will prefer to commission real people, who will stick to the creators they know and love, who think their work is worth it.<br>Of course, anyone can sympathize with not having money for needless luxuries, and in the end of the day, art is a luxury. No one needs it to live, you don&#39;t need a custom commission of art, or music, or anything to go about your day to day. But in the end, it&#39;s also wrong for people to compare the work of creators to AI and go &quot;oh if they can do it for $8 why are you charging hundreds&quot;? They can do it for $8 because millions before put in the time and effort for their work to now feed that program.<br>- While AI is unethical, and even if arguing about whether it&#39;s theft or not might not get us very far, the other reason why artists especially take it personally is because they have been getting this kind of disrespect since the beginning of time. They get their art stolen all the time, by companies to put on merch they have been not authorized for, by people claiming their work as their own, selling them on Redbubble, being used for personal projects without credit or direct claim to it, and when they speak up they are just expected to take it because &quot;oh they like your work, it&#39;s a compliment, don&#39;t be selfish&quot;. So when a larger company who could ask creators to cooperate with them and donate images for their app to learn from instead just pulls anything and everything to then monetize the use of their app they built on the backs of others, it&#39;s not too difficult to see why it can feel like another kick. Some react overly strongly, but at least some level of upset is absolutely understandable.<br>- While I understand your comparison to music, and the revolution of music from &quot;real instruments&quot; to electronic, same way traditional art turning digital and people being mad that it isn&#39;t real: you are right, people absolutely were, there are always those who hate change and cannot see further from their own methods and techniques and will think of other mediums as less than. However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the best comparison, because while closed minded people will hate new tools for no reason, they didn&#39;t necessarily take their work to make that new tool a reality. While AI is also a tool, it&#39;s again, unethical. That&#39;s just the best way to put it. SOme works will come out of it way more transformed from the originals, others won&#39;t. The real question is, what gives the right to the people who made it to tell their users &quot;yes, for a fee, you can use these creations we generated for you&quot; when they legally do not own most of the source that made their creation a reality? Even if it isn&#39;t illegal, it&#39;s leaving a bad taste in people&#39;s mouths, for similar reasons to my previous point.<br>- And my last point: many people defending AI, or the creators of these apps, try and advertise it as a tool for accessibility to help people who can&#39;t draw, are disabled or can&#39;t afford art. And that would be nice, except they only use these arguments as a shield, because they completely ignore the fact that many artists are also scraping by to make ends meet, are disabled, and have set time aside deliberately to hone their craft, which to some now feels like is being taken and peddled for cheaper to appease people who are either lazy, don&#39;t value their work, or want to turn the generated images for profit.<br><br>In conclusion: AI is a fun tool, and could very well coexist with creators - if they really were made in mind with creators, too. Like you said in the video too, there are many grey areas and it definitely isn&#39;t all black and white. <br>I really recommend you or anyone to watch Steven zapata&#39;s &quot;The End of Art: An Argument Against Image AIs&quot; because he puts every concern, pro and con way better in words than I could (and also mentions how the same company who took artist&#39;s work without consent had no issues making an AI generator for music WITH the cooperation of musicians and using free to use and royalty free resources).<br>Sorry this came out so long winded, love your channel and videos, keep up the good work.",-1

relevant,"Having been a programmer for decades, productivity has improved steadily the whole time. Growth in living standards relies on us all producing more in the same time. AI is a productivity tool not a replacement for many jobs. Going back to my early career,  improvements in development environments, debuggers, language choice and compiler speed produced a 10x improvement in productivity. Then, the internet came along and made it easier to find code examples, get help, collaborate and produced at least 3 to 5x further improvement in productivity. That&#39;s between 30 and 50x improvement in 40 years. Now with AI, I have an expert coding assistant to help me which is  especially useful when learning new things and reducing the need to reference manuals or look for examples resulting in another 3x improvement and will no doubt get even better. For context, the first compiler I used commercially took to several hours to compile a few hundred lines of code just to discover I had a syntax error. At no time during this journey have I felt my job threatened. I just produce 100x more work than I did all those decades ago. AI is another productivity tool.",1

This would allow the user to guide the AI to only the relevant parts of the code it needs to achieve a function so it doesn&#39;t get confused by the overwhelming amount of data.  It would also allow the user to troubleshoot each function in their code by checking the input and output values of the nodes.",-1

Around the same time, someone stole a shipment of brass instruments, and soon enough everyone in the ghetto miraculously started playing the trumpet or the saxophone. They weren&#39;t brass musicians, because they didn&#39;t have any formal training, so folks called them &#39;ass musicians&#39;. There was a lot of crossover between jism and ass in those days, and when it went mainstream in the late 1910s, early 1920s, people didn&#39;t want to seem crass, so they just called it jazz.

It took me some time to understand that in art, copycats are the rule, not the exception - even for prominent artists like Led Zepellin - and how we represent copyright legally is very biased towards protecting companies instead of individuals. That said, AI companies should pay artists that appear in their data, but in the end, art is much more than a personal style; it is the meaning you&#39;re trying to convey with art.

relevant,"I get what you&#39;re saying about the ethics of it but the massive difference between other human artists taking inspiration from others&#39;s art and a machine doing it to random artists on the internet is that when a person makes art inspired (not copied!!) by others it&#39;s never similar enough to harm the artists they were inspired by&#39;s income. If I drew fan art of a character people wouldn&#39;t just stop consuming the original product or buying original merch of it. Fanart is way less known from the original product it is based on so with that in mind you can see the difference between a small artist and a machine taking art from millions of unknown artists, taking credit for their hard work. We all know lensa but no one knows who were the original artists that it&#39;s AI was trained on. It&#39;s more similar to a huge fashion company stealing designs from small fashion designers and making profit off of it to an artist taking inspiration from others&#39;s art or making fan art. Also even if you knew who were the original artists when a machine is trained on people&#39;s artstyle to the point it can copy them almost exactly it harms the artists (who most of the time didn&#39;t concent or maybe even unaware of their art to used in this way) why would you as a non artist pay for the original product from the original creator when you can get a similar enough thing for Basically free or very cheaply from a machine? Basically what I&#39;m saying is that taking inspiration and letting a machine copy millions of artists artstyles is fundamentally different. Also y&#39;all seem to forget that we call out human art thieves too, it&#39;s just that machines are doing it on a mass scale and can hurt the community as a whole unlike a single human art thief.",-1

I also agree that such AI tool will be just another step above the programming language in the Layers of Abstraction chart. However, I don&#39;t necessarily see it as transparent as other items on the chart are. What I mean is that if a human uses a programming language, they understand it (ideally) and if they are not getting the results they want, they can debug their work. They can even make changes in the language itself or develop a new one! There still will be people who will learn to do so but all the others, without the knowledge, will be totally dependent on the AI tool and won&#39;t necessarily know how to achieve a different result if the tool doesn&#39;t give them what they envisioned.<br>At the moment, people who are involved with any of the items on the chart understand them (each his/her own field). This will not be the case with AI coding.<br>In summary, if the tool breaks down, there will be no coding (for people who didn&#39;t learn it).<br>Still, I am super excited for this development because even if I will never understand what it is doing under the hood I can get much better results than I can currently achieve with my zero programming knowledge.",1

However, as an intellectual property abolitionist (I will not get into why), a lot of the ethical arguments as it pertains to copyright and ownership are mute, because I don&#39;t believe that it is truly possible to own art beyond being able to say &quot;I made this&quot;, whatever that means, and I actually <i>did</i> find <i>that</i> particular section of the video very engaging.

Brandon Sanderson is <i>so involved</i> with his community/fandom, that being a <i>Cosmere</i> fan is nearly impossible to do without just being a <i>Brandon Sanderson</i> fan. He&#39;s so involved with his community, and I think that, at least <i>while</i> it&#39;s being written, an essential part of being active in the fandom is engaging with <i>Brandon himself.</i> Now, of course, this only applies to artists <i>like</i> Brandon Sanderson, who <i>are</i> extremely involved with their communities and fandoms, but that&#39;s not worth nothing.

If you give it context and ask it exactly what you want eg i want a switch statement for the following cases ... i ned if else for this and this is what i want to happen... now what that being said programming is is less about the syntax and more of usderstand the concepts and where when and how to use them. If you can grasp the concepts of coding then gpt is a great tool but you have to know exactly what your doing. Start small and grow from there  and when your stuck ask it how to do exactly what you what done and ask for examples.  Works like a charm  the whole point is to understand the concepts and how things work and then have it write your syntax for you and edit it as needed which you will have too almost ebery single time lol. But i love it its increased my productivity by 10x and has made me a better and smarter coder. I love that i dont have to go thru stacked overflow i can just ask gpt and sometimes you have to ask 10 times to understand how to do what to do but once you know you know forver so its worth it,-1

relevant,"I see some people worrying about music, so here&#39;s my take. AI will most definitely replace all forms of mainstream music. Because mainstream music has been spiritually and artistically dead for the a few decades. 99.9% of the songs you hear on the radio are simply products. Let&#39;s take some goofy poser like Drake. He doesn&#39;t write his own lyrics, he doesn&#39;t produce his own beats, he does none of the engineering in the studio, he takes no part in the cinematography of his clips. This guy shows up to the studio, he&#39;s handed a couple of lines, he raps for 3 hours, then leaves. A couple of weeks later the people in charge of making everything for him release his track and a clip video and he earns millions for doing none of the work. He&#39;s just a face for something that isn&#39;t real. Drake isn&#39;t an artist, he&#39;s just the personality used to ship that art under. And that applies to virtually all the most popular artists nowadays. They&#39;re just posers. They&#39;re just a celebrity being handed all the fame and recognition for something they truly didn&#39;t do. And all of that soulless process is reflected in how unoriginal, boring, uninspiring and simple their art is. This mainstream music has been made with methods resembling AI for decades already. For example, all a beatmaker has to do is load up FL studio, load up a premade template, jam on his keyboard for 30 minutes, hand his shit to an engineer to mix and master it and boom it&#39;s done. That&#39;s why a beatmaker can make dozens of beats a day. It&#39;s the artistic equivalent of McDonalds. It will be REALLY FUCKING EASY for AI to replace these factory workers (not artists, they&#39;re factory workers because they&#39;re just the individual processing units that end up making a finished product).  And honestly, I don&#39;t give a fuck because it won&#39;t make a difference anyway. It&#39;s not like there was any soul in this type of music in the first place. It will just become easier to ship out more artistic McDonalds so that drones can consume their daily dose of mind numbing noise.<br><br>Now to me there&#39;s another big category, and that is the artists that are still popular to the point of sometimes making it to the mainstream scene, while still having some form of artistic integrity. These people will either lose the rest of their integrity and let AI do shit for them, won&#39;t change their ways, or they might actually do the right thing for the art consciousness and decide to become better artists by partaking in more of their production, refusing to use that technology and trying to make higher quality art. But I&#39;m not familiar with this caliber of artists so let me head to the next category.<br><br>Now that&#39;s where it gets interesting in my opinion. There are many artists out there making authentic music out true passion and for the sake of art. These young artists that currently have 25 followers on Soundcloud will become the next generation of renowned artists. They&#39;re the pioneers. Because their music will be so unique that AI will never catch up to it. It will be so expressive and intimate that AI will never even come close. If anything, I see AI as something positive in that regards, because it will weed out all the people who were never &quot;artists&quot; in the first place, the posers, the people getting the fame for doing 5% of the work.<br>Then the REAL artists will shine. Because they&#39;ll be the only ones able to deliver something that moves humanity&#39;s soul. The ones that were ignored because their taste and style were too out of the box, too unordinary, too special, or simply too thought provoking will finally get the recognition that they deserved. They won&#39;t be left in the shadows anymore, in very small tightknit communities, or just alone. <br>The first half of this was quite negative because I have a fundamental disgust for cheaply made &quot;art&quot;. But the conclusion is positive. And I want to spread hope about this whole art situation, especially in music and in animation. <br>I know that to you reading this, I&#39;m just some random guy saying some random shit. But please trust me when I say that the next decade will show a marvelous and beautiful expansion of the boundaries of art. There&#39;s going to be so much boundary breaking, breath taking, impressive art that will push the art consciousness forward in realms never seen before. The culmination of thousands and thousands and thousands of years of collective work. And it will be amazing. I&#39;m genuinely looking forward to what these young unknown artists are cooking in their bedroom, or perhaps while traveling the world as vagabonds for inspiration. <br><br>You might actually be one of those artists I&#39;m talking about right now. If you are one of them, a misunderstood artist who knows he has something to say to the world, something to make it more beautiful, desperately trying to show the world what you&#39;re capable of to no avail, don&#39;t lose hope. Your time is coming. I know that it&#39;s hard when people judge your work on shit that doesn&#39;t matter instead of your message or the feeling you&#39;re trying to portray. But one day people&#39;s consciousness will open up to your expression, and they will listen. Keep practicing your craft, keep being mad scientist, keep chasing the things that make you feel alive. Don&#39;t be scared to be your true self, no matter how much people reject you. And I genuinely wish you the best of luck, future pioneer. I&#39;m looking forward to what you have to show to the world.<br>(and if you need someone to talk to, share your art to, and have conversations about that, let me know. The thing that brings me the most pleasure as an artist is helping people in the same situation as me and I&#39;d be so happy to share what I&#39;ve learned over the years.)<br><br>Godspeed.",-1

Clearly AI is a tool, but saying it like that&#39;s the end of the argument denies culpability by those who ostensibly have the power to prevent a known bad thing from happening with that tool. In particular, at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o09F6TViIGk&amp;t=950"">15:50</a> you say &quot;the whole point of AI is to make things more efficient, right? So, if you have to track and credit every single piece of data that goes in and goes out it will take way too long, so it defeats the purpose of efficiency&quot;. However, it seems to me that if it&#39;s too difficult to be done correctly and ethically, then it shouldn&#39;t be done at all. <br><br>No one is being forced to steal artists styles; that is an active choice being made, knowing that it will hurt the artist in question. That is clearly a problem.<br><br>I&#39;m a deep learning researcher and educator at my local university and when the topic of AI ethics comes up, I point my students to some AI principles that were put out by the Australian Government. These provide useful language to describe exactly what it is about AI systems that is unethical. <a href=""https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/australias-artificial-intelligence-ethics-framework/australias-ai-ethics-principles"">https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/australias-artificial-intelligence-ethics-framework/australias-ai-ethics-principles</a><br>Using this framework, we can see several ways the current form of AI art generation is unethical.<br>1. Human, societal and environmental wellbeing: as you point out, it is being used to undermine the livelihoods of current artists. That is, it has not been made to benefit society, but rather to enrich some bad actors. <br>2. Transparency and explainability: The biggest problem on this principle is that artists are being affected without ever agreeing to anything. They weren&#39;t given a choice; their art was collected and used without their knowledge, and this isn&#39;t made clear either to users or the people who&#39;s art was taken that this is happening, or how.<br>3. Contestability: On top of not being given a choice whether they want to participate, artists also have no recourse if they don&#39;t want to participate. They can&#39;t just choose to opt out.<br><br>Importantly, these principles also provide us a way to understand how to build ethical AI systems. So, an ethical AI art system would need to be:<br>1. Designed as a value add, rather than a redistribution. <br>2. Proper attribution MUST be given. The process by which the art is generated must be identifiable, and what inspirations were used.<br>3. Artists must be able to opt out. Their artworks must not be taken.<br><br>And the thing is... this wouldn&#39;t fundamentally break the technology. It would just take a bit of work. I actually disagree with the part I quoted from you on a completely different level, too. What you describe, where attribution is tracked, and the data that goes in and out absolutely can be tracked. It&#39;s not impossible. The database <b>already has</b> the attributions in some sense, otherwise it would be impossible to ask for &quot;art in the style of xxx&quot;. It <b>must</b> have been trained on that association in order to know it. So, the creators of these AI systems already have enough data to do attribution on the input side. Getting it for the output side is more tricky, but I believe it to be possible. Again, though, I think it is also necessary for the ethical creation of AI art.<br><br>The problem with making AI art a value add, rather than a redistribution isn&#39;t really a technical problem; it&#39;s a societal one. We have to view the AI generation as a tool, and treat it as such, rather than a drop-in replacement for a human artist.

At that point, I would have agreed with you. <br><br>For context, i am Lead SWE with 17 years experience, I read 3 AI papers each day, 5 years experience in AI.<br><br>What you missed:<br><br>- Complexity resolution scales exponentially. AI finds a problem twice as complex four times as difficult to solve. <br>- Overall iterative coding requires human coder input, and always will.<br>- Coders are not paid for hourly services but for expertise.<br>- Humans prefer talking to humans instead of robots.<br>- Most companies aren&#39;t cost optimisers. Many still use 90s software.<br>- Aggregate demand is infinite. When a project is finished, company wants to code something new.<br>- Look at production difficulties with RAGs. Read some experiences. AI stumbles on complexity of detail, and human input is required at every step, negating most of utility. These things aren&#39;t as easily solvable as you think.<br>- Closed source code is plentiful. Debugging embedded C++ software on a mobile device or microcontroller is distant future. You need physical hands to interact with devices.<br>- Early adoption of fully automated systems will be sensitive. A manager sees a bad result, and he gets pissed off much more. Psychological feeling of helplessness vs if there was  a human to talk to. Will hinder early adoption.<br>- Self driving cars work just fine 99% of the time. It&#39;s the 1% stopping adoption. Programming will be the same. The 1% bug will happen 30 days after product launch, everything will stop, and a human won&#39;t be able to fix it in 5 minutes since they didn&#39;t code it.<br>- Telling an AI what to do, you need a pro coder. Using natural language and arguing with AI does not exactly save time.<br><br>I agree programming will change in 5-10 years, but your estimate of 1-2 years is really laughable.

If, hypothetically, someone created an ai voice based on your singing and used it to produce music, then going on to <b>call it their vocal talent</b> because <b>they</b> directed the ai, I assume you would have an issue with this, because no matter how much time they spent perfecting the ai &amp; the result it spits out, it&#39;s not /their/ voice doing the singing. They could have put in the effort to learn how to sing while taking inspiration from your singing style, but they didn&#39;t, they instead chose to forcibly puppeteer a hacked-together simulation of YOUR throat to do the singing for them. This same principle applies to ai illustration. This is why it is, in a sense, theft. They are /solely/ using /other people&#39;s/ work and abilities to execute their creative vision.

AI can also create new things that have never been seen before (but Adam is right in that the new creations must be based off of data the AI has seen before.)

(Note that Adam did not provide a source for the idea that humans don&#39;t combine old stuff in new ways in a similar way to generative AI.)<br>2. The Bing Chat engine is not just generative AI, it can cite its sources, and is more similar to OpenAIs WebGPT model. It still has issues, but it&#39;s not the same as ChatGPT, which is generative AI + intelligently ranking outputs.<br>3.

And most are electronics techs, in addition to being mechanics.   Same thing with programming.  In the early days they were encouraging everyone to learn programming or coding.

relevant,"I appreciate that you&#39;re trying to look at the issue from more than one perspective, but it seems like there&#39;s a lack of understanding here when it comes to how AI uses existing artwork versus how people use art and life for reference. <br><br>For example, the late Kim Jung Gi was famous for the &quot;internal reference library&quot; he developed over years of practicing art. He looked at things that existed in life and in other art and committed it to memory, to the point where he could mentally recall how almost anything was supposed to look while he was drawing. But he wasn&#39;t just &quot;copying&quot; those things when he drew. His art was original and unique. After he passed, somebody fed his artwork to an AI program, and the result wasn&#39;t even close to the art that KJG created. That&#39;s because artists are REFERENCING an existing image or IP to create an original piece of art that is unique them and their style. In contrast,  AI is COLLECTING several images, and spitting out an amalgamation of all of those images put together.<br><br>AI doesn&#39;t &quot;understand&quot; the images that are being used to train it - it can&#39;t parse out things like structure and anatomy.

relevant,"The problem with the way the conversation is framed is that the machine intelligence or machine learning companies are doing something that no human being has done.<br><br>One of the reasons why a human artist is given a lot of slack with regards to “inspiration“ is very few of any human beings Can with any determine what part of something they listen to became part of the new song that they wrote. So we use a little bit of a fuzzy logic in order to determine what exactly has been done. And we have to use our judgment to decide if it infringes, and that’s what these court cases are all about. By the way, The thick case should not have been decided that way, just my opinion.<br><br>What’s different here is that the developers have created a mathematical computer model. They may claim that they can’t tell what’s inside of the algorithm that the machine learning system uses, but that’s almost a willful lack of knowledge. In other words, they weren’t able to come up with a true computer program to do what they wanted to do, so they were in a way a little Lazy(I know making a machine learning system is complicated, but it’s still simpler than programming each thing by hand), and so therefore they “don’t know what’s inside the black box.“<br><br>But that doesn’t matter. Because the computer system can do things with much more precision than human being could. What that means to me is that if they wanted to, if they cared about infringement, they could create a way to delineate where the inspiration actually came from in the “new works.“<br><br>More importantly however, because this system is computerized, and not a human being, these developers, in my opinion, have an obligation to make sure that any system that is trained on other peoples work has their permission.<br><br>A lot of machine learning advocates will argue that it should be an opt out system, not an in system. I disagree.<br><br>unlike human beings, who are difficult to keep track of, these tools are discreet. They can be altered in an objective way. And as a result, their developers have a responsibility to do so.<br><br>Otherwise, this whole endeavor feels like a colonial imperialist cultural attack. What ends up happening is that only those with a lot of resources can build these tools and make money off of them. So of course, to them, it seems perfectly reasonable that they are entitled to all of the work that everyone else is done without any compensation. And certainly without consent. <br><br>But if you look at the history of music specifically, this is Les the development of a new tool, and instead the development of a new era much like the beginning of the recorded music era.<br><br>At that time, most people didn’t understand the potential of recorded music. And so, somebody comes into town, says hey can I record you singing that song? They say sure, and they sign a paper. That paper, with complicated legal lease, signed over all of the rights not just to the recording, but very often to the song itself. These artist had no idea it was going on, because they didn’t understand radio or records or recording. And so it ends up happening is, MUSIC barons come in, get the rights to all sorts of music for close to nothing, make millions of dollars, and then in some cases even sue the original artist for infringement on the song that they wrote their rights away.<br><br>That is really what is happening here. It’s a new era of wealthy folks, and let’s face it they’re probably mostly white man, coming in and claiming rights to other peoples artistic works without any compensation.<br><br>I want to be clear, if you’re in a lab, and you’re trying to figure out how to build this sort of tool, as long as it’s limited to the lab, and not distributed to the rest of the world, train your beta prototype whenever you want.<br><br>But the data that you make it available to the general public, especially but not limited to making money off of it, you need to retrain from scratch your tool. You need to insist that anyone who contributes opt in. there is more than enough music and art and writing that is in the public domain that there should be plenty enough to train the systems. And then, much like stock photography websites, if you need more or want more source material, then you offer people the opportunity to opt in. Either give them the service for free, allow them to make their own little personalized machine learning generative system just on their style, or perhaps you have to pay them.<br><br>Both Adobe and Getty images are playing games with their terms of service and forcing their contributors to opt out, and while they have at least legally covered themselves, ethically they’re pulling a fast one. Mostly because the people who have contributed to those websites make part of their living off of being a part of it, and at least an Adobe case, they are extorting those artists by saying “you can opt out, but then you can’t sell your other works on Adobe stock anymore.“ so then you force these artist to choose between whether or not they get to continue to make money, but create competitive works because it’s part of firefly, or they pull out of the firefly system, and have to find someplace else to make their money.<br><br>Artificial intelligence machine learning generative systems must be opt in. the idea that these companies can just pull anything on the Internet just because they want to is wrong. The main reason being that users can create prompts which will generate derivative works that are in the style of another artist, effectively making that artist style no longer unique to them.<br><br>And by the way, it does make a difference whether or not you have the skill to execute something. Yes, human ideas are interesting and important. But it is in the execution that the work exist. While it is true that a lot of tools have made this execution easier, generative AI systems frankly make it too easy. If you can generate a song and someone else’s styling under a minute, that may satisfy your creative endeavor, but you didn’t do the hard part which was created the style.",-1

Dsclaimer, I feel the same way about Mozart, and agree with Wagner, that when you hear it, you can hear the dishes being washed in the background (i.e., elevator music for the old royalty).<br>The scary part is that I believe AI will eventually compose a Matthew Passion and a B minor mass.  Most of Bach is formulaic - it has to be, because he dashed off a cantata a week. We&#39;re just lucky enough not to know what the formula is - yet.  But AI can spot it, and will churn out not 48 preludes and fugues, but 48,000 preludes and fugues.  And go the good will blend into the awful in an even spectrum, because the one thing that AI cannot do (yet) is to appreciate music.  Not a huge problem, because Beethoven composed the 9th when he was deaf. But that&#39;s effectively what AI will be doing.  Composing by numbers. Writing, but never HEARING music.

Because it sounds good enough to put on Spotify?<br><br>There is not much there for my mind to connect to.  Because I never just <b>hear</b> music … I <b>relate</b> to music, and to the emotions and people behind them.<br><br>That includes someone banging around on kitchen utensils.  Still an emotion, and a person there.  Or even when I mishear or misunderstand the lyrics of a song.  Misunderstandings are part of the relationships between humans, there is still something to relate to.<br><br>Would I listen to monkey music?  Sure, and I would relate to whatever the monkey does, as a monkey.<br><br>Would I listen to 100% generated AI music?  Sure, and I would wonder how the AI comes up with it, and what it means.<br><br>Would I listen to music from a trained AI that imitates the music it is trained on?  Sure, and I would wonder what songs trained the AI, and what the human felt and thought who selected that particular song.<br><br>It doesn’t have to be an active thought, it often is just an instinctive reaction to what I hear and see … I automatically associate feelings, situations, performances, instruments, people and more.  But now I can also associate AI and the people who use it.  This can be just another thing on the palette.  But when the art is cheaply imitating others, then it is not so interesting to me.<br><br>I don’t think we are capable of separating art completely from its creation.  Even for Banksy art, we all wonder who Banksy is and what he or she or they might think and feel.  Even when we don’t know the name of the artist or the title of the art.<br><br>Provenance matters to us … because it just does!  It is what makes the art relatable.  Even if we don’t know much about where some art comes from, then the speculation about it, the mystery, is part of the art.  Think of Mona Lisa.  Who is she and what does her smile mean?  We want to know, or at least we want to speculate.  That is what makes Mona Lisa fascinating.  There is nothing about the picture itself that is particularly different from other pictures in that style.  The smile is mysterious by itself, yes.  But why?<br><br>Can an AI come up with a Mona Lisa?  Yes, of course!  But it takes a person to see that the AI-generated Mona Lisa is “interesting” in some way.  And others can feel the same way about it.  So, we really relate much more to the person who said: “this is interesting” than to the AI.<br><br>An AI can, in principle, just generate <b>any</b> form of art (simply by iteratively generating all possible art — it would take aeons to do that, but in principle it could do it).  Or an AI can imitate any artist’s art, and even meld it with the art of other artists.  But it would be endlessly boring to look at every piece of “art” chucked out by an AI.  What we care about is the pieces of AI art that a human pre-selected for us … because they found them relatable.<br><br>A face on the Moon or on Mars is much more interesting and relatable when we think (and feel) that some beings created them.  When weather and erosion created them, then they are still beautiful, but as an act of nature, and we relate to that in a different way.  And if it was an AI who created these faces, then we want to know who created the AI, and why.<br><br>In the end, AI is a tool.  This will only change at the point where AI becomes indistinguishable from a human, in all aspects.  And at that point we have the deeply disturbing problem of finding out what makes humans human.  Including consciousness, and how our experience of existing in the world works.  We will be in deep trouble at that point, because we don’t really know how to find answers for these questions.",-1

Same with drawing - I pretty much gave up because it require way too much discipline and time that I would rather spend hanging out with friends, reading, or playing video games.<br>  Then when I was 17, I finally got serious about art and music. I really wanted to express myself through those mediums. So I spent my free time playing guitar, playing piano, drawing everything around me, and learning the techniques that great artists and musicians use to create great music and art. It took a bit of patience, but within a year, there was a difference, and that made me want to see how much better I could get. It was a journey that made every work of art or piece of music not simply a reflection of my emotions or place in life, but a stillframe of a moment in my journey to better the skills that I had been working on and dreaming of since I was a little kid.<br>   I&#39;m 38 now.

I&#39;ve long been saying that there are arguments against it, but people weren&#39;t making them, or weren&#39;t making them well. That said, I have a few notes:<br><br>Programming is an interesting AI case, because folks just entering the industry (or folks without any experience) think writing code is the hard part, and it absolutely IS NOT. The hard part is asking the right questions and actually conceptualizing the full scope and impact of your intent. Easily the worst part of these code generators is that when wired together into a complex system, debugging becomes nightmare level because every component is essentially a black box to the person who made it. AI debugging will surely happen someday, but afaik no one has introduced anything like that currently (and I suspect that it will be one of the harder problems, as often times &quot;errors&quot; weren&#39;t errors when the software was written and are only errors because of changes in the environment the software runs in, or changes in the usage or requirements for it.)<br><br><br>It isn&#39;t clear if humans are actually any more capable of originality than the computer is -- a computer&#39;s originality comes from random numbers very explicitly, but human creatively necessarily also just comes from random numbers, albeit, in the form of small variations in current between synapses or errors in transcription of memories or other such elements. (Unless you believe that minds are not merely a system made out of your meat -- in which case, well, I&#39;m not going to find your reasoning convincing.)<br><br>&quot;My work isn&#39;t just remixing everything I&#39;ve read, it&#39;s reinterpreting though my own subjective experience.&quot; Uh... what do you think your subjective experience and biases _are_? Are they not the messily synthesized sum of everything you&#39;ve ever seen and experienced, plus any random errors in storage and retrieval? The main difference is that the current AI models that are widely accessible to the public are purpose-specific. So you have an LLM trained exclusively on text or an image generator trained exclusively on images. When they start being trained cross domain the difference between AI models and human cognition gets blurrier and blurrier. <br><br>Human&#39;s writing inspired stories DO result in lawsuits ALL THE TIME. (It&#39;s just that people suing lose those lawsuits.) Artist also get very very weird with each other over &quot;copying their style&quot;, which indeed is a thing that you can&#39;t copyright but an awful lot of young-un&#39;s seem to think you can (and I see that carried over to these discussions -- the fact that it reproduced your style is not where copyright infringement could have taken place -- it&#39;s the training that leads to the new illustration that&#39;s at question, not the result.)<br><br>Current AI algorithms are, indeed, not doing what people do. I&#39;d argue its more like we trained a pool of ... mmm... jellyfish or sponges to reproduce art. It takes so so so much data because it&#39;s ability to &quot;understand&quot; things is so very limited. That, however, is changing rapidly. One major area of study is to reduce training set sizes -- there are many strategies toward this, but ultimately it boils down to giving the AI more context to work from, more knowledge of the world. They&#39;re becoming legitimately smarter. And while &quot;AGI&quot; isn&#39;t a thing with a horizon anyone should take seriously (because its goalposts are on rocket sleds), everything in AI is improving at an astounding speed. Improving doesn&#39;t merely mean getting better at reproducing some person&#39;s art without horrow-show hands, it means actually making the system smarter.<br><br>Another use of this kind of &quot;AI&quot; that no one ever talks about and treats as perfectly fine is Google Translate, which is actually where this kind of &quot;deep learning&quot; was first deployed at this kind of massive scale. It was initially trained on things like UN documents, which are not copyrighted, but the Google search of the last 10 years is trained off of every localized web page on the internet, exactly like all of the other AI models going on now. If it&#39;s ok, then these others must be, and if they aren&#39;t, then it can&#39;t be either.<br><br>&quot;Training it right&quot; would insulate the companies but it wouldn&#39;t actually protect artists, all of the material harm would be the same. The only difference would be in the interior of the Machine, which artists have in visibility into, so maybe that resolves &quot;ethical&quot; issues but it doesn&#39;t actually resolve any of the material impact on the artists. And I&#39;ve gotta say, I don&#39;t really care about anything other than the material impact on the artists. If my work is copied and I never know about it and it does not materially impact me, I don&#39;t understand why I should care. In fact, I don&#39;t understand why we should entertain someone caring in that circumstance.<br><br>The clown-shoes AI CEOs are deeply living in Silicon Valley Venture Capital culture. They&#39;re basically the same as Uber and a dozen other companies. The Valley has basically decided that laws don&#39;t actually apply to them, because they have enough money to just pay and ignore fines. Unfortunately, that&#39;s worked out for them thus far so I&#39;d expect more of that behavior over time.<br><br>You covered the Google book decision, but that was specifically testing if Google could share excerpts of copyright work. AI training really doesn&#39;t align with that, as you noted. What it <del>does</del> align with is Search. Search has been ruled legal in different cases with different criteria.

Would any art that an AGI (Artificial General intelligence) produced be considered ‘inspired’ or just ‘copied’. Before we explore this some more, I think we need a definition on the difference between AGI and the current AIs (also called weak or narrow AIs). “AGI is the ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.” “Strong AI contrasts with weak AI (or narrow AI), which is not intended to have general cognitive abilities; rather, weak AI is any program that is designed to solve exactly one problem.” Note however that I got this from Wikipedia, as I don’t specialize in any AI or robotics field, so the definition I provided may be off. If anyone in the comments could provide a better definition or contrast that would be appreciated. Anyway, because AGI has general cognitive abilities would that make the art it makes ‘inspired’, as I would assume it would be able to abstract the art it sees into something new or is it still ‘copied’ as it still has to take references of other art to be able to abstract a new piece of ‘art’. Again I want to reiterate that I am not an expert in AIs or robotics so I might be misrepresenting AGIs and how they operate so take my explanation as a grain of salt. So, any artists reading this do you think that any art that an AGI ever makes is either ‘copied’ or can they be ‘inspired’ and make original art.",1

I was discussing this exact topic with one of my traditional media professors today, among some classmates, so allow me to share a college-art students’ perspective.<br><br>Seeing AI’s power is scary. My professor shared my worry in discussing my career path- but not at all in a discouraging way, more of a, “make sure you stand out in your field, work to be very unique” sort of way. When discussing it with my peers earlier this morning, we agreed that it can be a very helpful tool, but more often it’s upsetting. Hearing that Kim Jung Gi’s art, (an extremely respected illustrator among creatives, and for good reason) was stolen and uploaded to these databases without his family’s consent a while ago infuriated me to my very core. It’s horrible. This happened the day directly after he passed.<br><br>If there were regulations, and artists were fairly compensated for their work being used, I think more creatives would be okay with the programs, but at the moment, it’s more than a slight cause of anxiety.<br><br>On tiktok, I see younger artists feeding their work into the programs, and being amazed at the results. I find that this is very harmful- most often, the AI completely changes the work- and while it may be cool to see, often using the programs removes a lot of emotion out of pieces. If there’s any advice I have for younger artists, it’s that- while it’s fun to mess around with AI (it can be a helpful tool! It’s not taboo) please don’t lean on it. The best way to improve is practice, studies, and more specifically studying your favorite artists’ techniques.<br><br>I didn’t mean for this to be rant-like at all, just thought it was a coincidence to see a video on the topic after I’ve had some bigger discussions about it today. <br>Stay safe out there! : )",1

In case of accidents, such as obstruction on the roadway it would slow down and make all of the cars automatically avoid that lane until the obstruction were removed, the cars themselves would be reporting the obstructions to the freeway AI as they drove.  I think this type of system would really fix self driving because instead of millions of cars trying to drive themselves with no idea what the other cars are doing it would be managing the traffic as a whole, organizing the cars based on destination.  This type of system would have to completely lock out the driver, they couldn&#39;t touch the the controls until the freeway got them on the off ramp.  Eventually the freeway would hand the car off to a city street AI which would take over driving from there.    Rolling slow downs might be completely eliminated.

Let&#39;s call that use case tier 1, with a very, very basic skilled operator. In order to really multiply performance, it is very needed to have a highly skilled AI operator, with deep knowledge not only of the language dialect, but also algorithms, data structures and the like, use case tier 2. So, we still are very far from &#39;no programmers&#39; land&#39;, but at the same time, performance multiplication already is a reality and has been so for some months. To achieve that no programmers&#39; land situation, LLMs or the next engine will need to be able to generalize requirements, features, requisites, when never being presented to them before.

All past revolutions freed up time and labour for humanity to use their brains into solving other problems or developing new thoughts and arts. Humanity could spent time and resources into other stuff, that created more stuff, that required new, and more skilled, labour. We swapped human muscle for animal muscle and then for mechanical muscle, but the human brain was always behind it. This time a techonology is challenging that. All of that, even the artistic/creativity part of it that we thought would be always inherently ours.<br> It won&#39;t be as fast as we thought when ChatGPT was 98% accurate but it won&#39;t be &quot;just another stepped improvement&quot; now that is just 2% accurate (for whatever reason). <br>Besides, this is the first technology with a capacity to improve itself, we have no precedent for that.<br>I don&#39;t see a genocidal AI in the near future because even if the potential is there, it is also easily preventable; but the economic disruption of AI could be total the moment we achieve an AGI as capable as any human.

Not only in the guitar world, but in every sphere - yet, it is the nuances that resonate with us.  <br><br>My point being: AI is very cool and will get a lot of things done.

But everyone is now seeing a path to making money with AI and that is always when things ramp up. I&#39;ll be impressed if by the end of this decade we have one that can do flawless math. Not helping a 4th grader, but replacing the entire accounting dept at say Apple and other IRS and Wall Street type math applications that have real consequences. Of course there will be accountants for a long time because a big part of accounting is not simply making the number columns add up correctly, but creatively using those numbers to maximize profits within the grey areas of the law. Speaking of the laws, AI will be in court as people and companies sue because of some bad outcome because they did what AI told them. So lots of lawsuits in the future and we all know how extremally slow the laws are catching up with technical advancements.<br><br>The real benefit of AI in the next couple decades will be as an aid to humans due to its speed which we are already finding out today. The advancements in material sciences, medicine, etc. will be enormous because the computer can do thousands of simulations that would take humans many years longer. Then the humans can take the best results and work on those as a huge time saver.",1

World where AI will take over everything which human was learned for is just a world with ruined society. Humans has to learn, has to develop and from that we can get true happines. Humanity would just stop AI because replacing us in everything we do is a short way to destroy our kind and society.

relevant,"Transcript:<br><br>It’s late, pitch dark, and a self-driving car winds down a narrow country road. Suddenly, three hazards appear at the same time. What happens next? Before it can navigate this onslaught of obstacles, the car has to detect them— gleaning enough information about their size, shape, and position, so that its control algorithms can plot the safest course. With no human at the wheel, the car needs smart eyes, sensors that’ll resolve these details— no matter the environment, weather, or how dark it is— all in a split-second. That’s a tall order, but there’s a solution that partners two things: a special kind of laser-based probe called LIDAR, and a miniature version of the communications technology that keeps the internet humming, called integrated photonics. To understand LIDAR, it helps to start with a related technology— radar. In aviation, radar antennas launch pulses of radio or microwaves at planes to learn their locations by timing how long the beams take to bounce back. That’s a limited way of seeing, though, because the large beam-size can’t visualize fine details. In contrast, a self-driving car’s LIDAR system, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, uses a narrow invisible infrared laser. It can image features as small as the button on a pedestrian’s shirt across the street. But how do we determine the shape, or depth, of these features?<br><br>----------------------",-1

If AI tech development stopped, you could still improve the models for years to come with a whole lot of work. Particularly for AI art with the right input and tags and retraining.

While AI technology is certainly changing the way music is created and consumed, it is not necessarily a negative development that will &quot;destroy&quot; the industry.<br><br>In fact, AI is already being used to enhance the music industry in a variety of ways, such as generating personalized playlists, analyzing data to inform marketing and promotional strategies, and even composing music.

Human creativity and emotion are still fundamental components of music, and AI can only assist in the creative process.<br><br>Overall, while AI will certainly have an impact on the music industry, it is unlikely to completely destroy it.

relevant,"I personally think that AI will will stagnate on a few key areas that prevents it from replacing programmers altogether. This is specifically refuting the &quot;PM -&gt; coding AI -&gt; QA&quot; loop mentioned in the video.<br><br>1. Debugging large projects - AI is good at building individual components, but to integrate multiple components together AI will need to fully understand the previous code outputs to the very last detail or it will write the wrong design that breaks in rare and strange ways that do not happen in code written by a human. Even if the AI is very advanced and can fix these problems when prompted, non-technical human QA will have trouble understanding and prompting it back to the AI. This problem can only be solved by replacing the QA with AI as well - and hence creating an AI that never makes any mistakes through solving any it finds internally. That is an extremely tall ask compared to where AI is currently.<br><br>2. Performance - nontechnical people may have an idea of the functionality of a product, but ultimately code (even AI-generated) still runs on computers and are subject to computational complexity. Performance optimizations are highly context-dependent and generally online training data tells AI the most general way to solve a problem, which will be slower in compute. This implies that a technical person with knowledge of programming will still be required to create any software that gets value in being performant.<br><br>3. Training data - I am pessimistic in general of whether LLMs can ever get out of the training data problem. Inherently, even the best LLMs only work as long as one similar example is present on the internet. They stop working if asked to do something that the internet has no example for, and thus the LLM is unable to train to understand. Even if LLM compute power and quality improves exponentially, the quantity of meaningful training data will not, so LLMs will struggle with any niche subjects which are common in programming in the cutting-edge.<br><br>This is not to say that AI to replace programmers will never come, but I don&#39;t think the path of improving LLM technology will get us there. I think we truly need something that can think and solve problems like humans and therefore solve the data problem with meaningful AI-generated data.",-1

Let people comment it, use it, learn from it etc. It does NOT necessary mean that I automatically want to allow my materials to be used for training AI. <br><br>What they did with Open AI, ChatGPT and all kind of similar stuff, is that they put there millions of data - data that nobody knows how it was gathered. Also, it is very hard to find out if your graphic, image, code or music was downloaded and used to train AI. <br><br>I think that a new license is needed, something like: &quot;free for personal use (and / or commercial) but NOT free for training AI algorithms&quot;. Why ? Like I said. At my work (Software Engineer) the concept of sharing, the concept of open source is pretty natural. I share something I know, some other human being shares something different.

In the event of a potential accident (such as the falling boxes) the SDC could put out a &quot;distress signal&quot; to the other SDCs on the road, and then swerve towards them. The other SDCs could then accommodate the swerving car by moving to the side, accelerating, or hitting the brakes, and they could do this with the knowledge of what other cars around them would and would not (i.e. human-driven cars) be able to react in time.

relevant,"To Mrs. Zhou, and to all people in the comment section, I understand the concerns that AI brings about. At best, I am optimistic with the progression made on AI, but at the same time, I am very cautious about it at the same time. Given its advancement in recent years like OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT, I am sure it is all impressive stuff, but what I have long spoken about, and what I do fully perpetuate, is that having AI replacing every single job in existence, is very reckless, and tends to cause more harm than good. And God forbid we ever tie an AI to a missile silo. That will be an absolute travesty, and it will be a massive indictment to self-destruction. That&#39;s why there should be red lines that should not be crossed when it comes to using artificial intelligence in general.<br><br>At best, only most areas could be replaced with AI, completely or partially, but with the likes of cooking, policy enforcement (looking directly at you Google, DeviantArt, and YouTube), and certain other fields, are better off not being used for artificial intelligence. At best, with the likes of editing and creating source code, they can be an exception, but by all means, they can make creating source code more efficient, and the editor just needs to edit other areas of the code so they can be satisfactory in the given outcome.<br><br>In addition to the topic of policy enforcement like bots to content ID systems, which is what the likes of what YouTube, Google, and DeviantArt had been using for years, is just as reckless. Because for a start, artificial intelligence in general, lacks a conscience, thus they cannot accurately make the best of moral decisions, especially when it comes to punishing people and taking down contents. That&#39;s why policy enforcement, and taking down content that violates the policies and guidelines, are better off being handed to people rather than machines.<br><br>As for AI Art Generation on the other hand, I also do firmly believe we need more restrictive measures on those systems, like making them far more expensive to use, while fairly giving the person the right to own the art themselves.<br><br>In conclusion, those things I propose could much better compromises, rather than totally disallowing them. I was talking to the ChatGPT AI about the general rising hatred and fear of artificial intelligences, and even itself, does agree with that I am saying. I will provide the answers it gave within a text file, with the additional steps to ensure the safety of society.

relevant,"Since roughly ten people tried to disprove my point about AI not being Art on my other comment and I love to nerd out about art theory, here a definiton of Art: Art is artistic intent, skill and technology combined. Technology ist defined by the tools available at the time and is important in the sense of HOW art as a human endeavor evolved. If an elephant draws you have skill and technology but questionable artistic intent. If a toddler draws, you have artistic intent and technology but a lack of skill, since they have to learn how to handle any kind of tool. If someone has the skill to use the tool, the tool itself and artistic intent they are an artist. To explain why AI is not art, we have to look closer at the factor skill: Skill is defined by being able to do and explain every step of the artistic process from start to finish. If you can do this, you can recreate your art any way you like. For example: If you have an artist around, ask them how they did the picture. What tools did they use? Why did they choose this composition. How did they mix their colors or blend the pencil. They can answer you all questions about the process and the higher the skill, the more questions they can answer in detail. Now ask someone using AI exclusively, without further work put in, about their process. The answer will be pretty short. Artists are always craftspeople first and foremost. They fail over and over again to get better at what they do. Dancers land on their asses, woodworkers break the wood apart, sculptors destroy their work by chipping too much away or destroying their bronze molds, visual artists create tons of bad art before creating good art and musicians annoy their neighbors with disharmonious noise before they play great music. And for all of them the drive to do art and get better is the love of creation, the high when you hit the right notes, the satisfaction of using your hands to form a piece of wood into a chair and the joy of letting the tool glide over the surface and leaving a portrait or illustration or whatever and to know, you will never stop learning. And it&#39;s okay, if you don&#39;t want to spend your free time constantly failing and learning and failing, if you just want to fiddle around to get some pretty pictures from a piece of software, but own up to it and don&#39;t call yourself an artist.

I have a feeling there is a lot of software offered out there under now the guise of AI but it just a regular software program. What would be interesting, and I&#39;m just fantasising now....  a program that is trained by the tracks you have on your own computer, for instances, stuff you created with a D.A.W. All the seperate files, the entire songs, the plugin chains. And then after a month or so of training the software is able to give you suggestion when you make new stuff as a kind of sparring partner or generate complete songs, but they will have your own sound signature. Of course there has to be a failsafe that this information isn&#39;t shared with other parties. I would call it Personal A.I. like how the original PC was the home version that could do the same stuff as a large mainframe. While on the one hand I have concerns over AI in how it can disrupt our lives as musicians but at the same time it&#39;s also an entertaining thought that one day there will be a DAW where you can say out loud to it what you want in the song and a version comes out and then you can also mix and master it just using spoken suggestions &quot; more gain at 500 HZ, take the cutoff down on the synth bus in the re-intro and gradually open it up, &quot;  etc etc. I think this is really gonna happen soon.",-1

There are totally autonomous  vehicles, no steering wheel or driver in current development not more that a year or two away.<br>Although currently limited, specific areas and speed, there is only room to grow. <br><br>Will Self driving cars exist for every use case cars currently occupy? Likely not for decades if ever, but the use use cases even possible in the near future are incredible, and more importantly for development, profitable.<br><br>2) self driving cars while not being as efficient as public transportation are better than everyone driving their own cars. You seem to think that the solution for the USA is to totally remodel the country&#39;s transportation network. <br><br>While with a blank slate of infrastructure this would be a better option to plan out, it is clearly not going to happen any time soon in the USA.<br><br>The culture, geography, economy of the USA will  make this change almost impossible, the USA is not Europe. <br><br>Self driving vehicles may actually increase efficiency reduce the amount of vehicles on roads by allowing Self driven vehicles to operate all with diffrent passengers day instead of sitting in parking lots all day.

relevant,"Years ago, I started doing digital art using my Wacom tablet. Lots of people, including other artists, criticized me, saying that what I was doing wasn&#39;t real art or that it was &quot;easier,&quot; therefore less valuable. Now, AI has appeared, and I&#39;ve been experimenting with it as a time-saver for sketches. I do a prompt with the idea I have in mind, and what comes out always looks unfinished and messy. So, what do I do? I make my art on top of it, using what the AI created as a base just to make my workflow faster.<br><br>I&#39;ve been doing art for about 15 years now. I&#39;m used to a multitude of techniques – realism, cartoon, manga, surrealism, perspective, and all that shit. I&#39;ve done oil painting, graffiti, clay sculptures, 3D art, charcoal art, watercolor, and, to be honest, anything the AI does, I&#39;m able to do by myself. So, why did I start using it? Because I&#39;m fucking tired of doing boring shit! I want to focus on the things I like drawing. So, when AI appeared, I was happy about it because I knew it could help me make my workflow faster. Instead of working on the boring stuff for hours and hours, I can focus on the things that are my specialty – the things I actually like doing. In my case, it&#39;s the human figure. I don&#39;t really like doing scenery and stuff; it&#39;s boring and time-consuming. But even if I&#39;m using AI to help me with it I still need to touch it up and fix a lot of crap because I&#39;m never 100% satisfied with what the AI gives me. So, in the end, the final result, the art looks absolutely different from what the AI did.<br><br>I don&#39;t hide on my social media the fact that sometimes I like using AI to help me, but when I say that, people don&#39;t believe me. They say the art I made is 100% AI and that I didn&#39;t draw anything, and that simply isn&#39;t the truth. They demand me to do fucking videos showing my process. They start to literally interrogate me as if I needed to prove anything! And shit, most times, the AI only does about 20% of the piece and i don&#39;t even use it in all my drawings. As I said before, I only use it as a base, a sketch. Shit, people are accusing me of using AI even in the art where I didn&#39;t use AI at all. People are crazy about that shit. They say I&#39;m stealing art; they say I&#39;m not a real artist; they say I&#39;m lying. Shit, even when I show proof that I can draw and that I&#39;ve been doing it for ages, people are still nagging the fuck out of me. Like, leave me alone! Let me do my fucking art in whatever way I like doing it! If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t fucking look at it and go fuck yourself. Fuck, people are really annoying about it. I just want to do my shit in peace. Fucking hell. it&#39;s the same crap from when i started doing digital art all over again. i agree when people say that if someone just did a prompt than this person isn&#39;t really an artist, youre right they&#39;re just prompters and it&#39;s worse when this person doesn&#39;t even use some photoshop to make it look better or something like that because in the end it&#39;s something 100% made by the ai, no soul in it, but not everyone uses this technology the same way, people like me do exist. even if you don&#39;t believe it.",-1

One wants to feel like being a friend to the artist by having a piece of his thoughts.

AI doesn&#39;t have acess to reality, it works as a logical system upon certain premises or axioms - humans do. We have to make sense of our experience to make sense of the world around, including other works of art that come to them as a given object as any other. When someone asks you to explain what a cat is, you&#39;ll be using the experiences you directly had with actual cats to do so, not a &#39;database&#39; of second to third hand information - AI doesn&#39;t operate at that level, it only concludes logically a given data, which is the reason why those new technologies such as Nightshade are so able of fooling them. It&#39;s a computational mechanism, not a &#39;epistemical&#39; one. Also, AI imitates a style not by it&#39;s true cause. Take for example an oil painting with loose strokes - an AI is able to imitate the manner without the access to a real brush or ink, and make it seems as if it were painted, when in fact it wasn&#39;t, is just a pixel analysis that resambles a picture taken from the original. If you know something about painting and already asked for an AI to make one in a particular style, you&#39;ll notice how strange normally it seems - they&#39;re normally too smooth, or its brush strokes are irrational. This is also true when it imitates a given trace, which is sourced on the mechanical predicates of our shoulders and wrists articulations, when it doesn&#39;t have any hand or arm whatsoever. It cannot considered as a mere &#39;copy and paste&#39; copy, nor plagiarism of our usual kind, is in a level of mathematical imitation in various manners that human beings aren&#39;t capable of directly doing (if you take digital artists for example, which works involves pixels - though photographers might be included as well - it is as if the machine were able to copy their DNA/celular information there and transpose it, much more different than making an statue with clay). In my understanding is a copying machine by design and can&#39;t possibly stand in its own feet as it only produces second to third hand products (photographers and included in this), and in order to this be different (in any other regard as well) it needs much more than today computational capacities, it needs a way bridging the gap between its logical capacities and outside world.",-1

The AI would also automatically print a watermark or signature on the final piece after processing so people know who it was sourced from.

Unless you somehow associate your art station username with something NSFW in the training set, to get filtered out or something. Have people not read the CLIP paper? It works because of scale the training set is 5B image-caption pairs. And with the push for accessibility on the web ... Captions will improve. If you have a good clip model, you can train and image decoder against it. Model weights will only learn a bad distribution of the quality of image - caption pairs drop. Or maybe use a clip model to filter you dataset. In the end, they used a clip model to create bad data and try to inject it for specific concepts. At a rate of 3:2. Or 1% of pre training. Which is 5M images with intetionally bad captions. <br><br>Invisible watermarks or adversarial attacks can be detected and defeated by tweaking the convolutional steps and pool shape.

relevant,"AI can&#39;t paint. It just creates digital images imitating the style of existing and past artists. The products produced can&#39;t be copywritten, so anything it creates is public domain. And those seeking to claim ownership/authorship over AI generated content without citing it as being AI generated are being unethical, at best, and perpetrating outright fraud at worse.  As is, how the systems work based on text prompts is no more a creative endeavor than editors or commissioners of work go through to convey what they want from a writer or artist, a process which conveys not authorship rights to the editor or commissioner of the work (what does convey ownership is that works are often works-for-hire with copyright ownership, wholly or in part, being transferred as a result of payment.)  The fact that it is an iterative process with AI systems to get the desired result doesn&#39;t de facto make the process any more creative than an editor/commissioner evaluating a work and requesting changes to it.  If one is to assert authorship/ownership over generated AI content on these grounds, then every editor in existence would be able to claim the same and that is patently absurd.<br><br>Creating derivative works still require payment and/or permission of the copyright owner. Using AI which has learned from copywritten materials is a violation of copyright of the creators - though AI proponent claim &quot;fair use&quot; because, they argue, &quot;people learn the same way&quot; which shows a shallow understanding of how people learn - we don&#39;t need a comprehensive data set to learn from and we can self-monitor what we create to improve it, and we can apply experiences unrelated to the examples we&#39;re exposed to to inform what is created , something that AI systems are currently incapable of doing. Also, without using a substantial portion of the copywritten works, the AI systems could never ever generate anything &quot;in the style of&quot; a living artist.  Just have it try to create something that it has NOT had added to its learning database -- it can&#39;t (but people can and do all the time.) Anything that is generated is, by definition, derivative of existing works. The fact that works created are &quot;in the style of&quot;  human writers and artists just proves this point.  The issue of copyright issues arises when such works are created on the basis of living creators works, which are copywritten and protected, and duplicating their works to create derivative works raises legitimate questions of copyright and the notion of &quot;fair use.&quot;<br><br>Fiction, lyrics, and other creative output expresses nothing more than a simulacrum of human experiences. They will not provide any new insights or interpretations of relationships or interactions as the systems can&#39;t experience, for itself, such things to inform their content creation.  It will remain inferior to what people create because of this, but the fact is that mediocre content will suffice for most commercial needs and, as such, will be used by corporations to eliminate the costs associated with hiring writers, artists, musicians and other creative types - so long as their delivery is limited to the digital realm.

Yes, there are some AI programs that already produce music (basic electronic instrumentals for now) but creating cohesive lyrics and melodies with a great singing voice... that&#39;s nowhere near. What I first like to see, as a proof of concept, is an AI program that can transform a guide vocal into the voice of a world class singer. So, basically changing the vibrato and timbre of a mediocre singer into a great performance, that you can then tweak to your own liking. Imagine a &quot;Virtual Singer&quot; instead of a virtual guitarist. I wonder how close something like this? The best thing any artist can do now is keep very close attention to AI developments, stay up to date and figure out how you can use it for your own benefit. Use it as a tool, so it won&#39;t become a replacement.",-1

The average being 13 words?? <br>When I studied, we got this thing called &quot;briefing&quot; which is basically the instructions we have to follow to create a piece. The briefing can be incredibly detailed (I&#39;ve gotten briefings that were 3-page long PDFs with both descriptions and visual references for my commissions!!) or very brief and open for the artist to do whatever (my class joined an art contest and we had to make a piece that would reflect the theme: &quot;Behind the mask&quot; ) <br>Tbh, most AI promoters sound more like commissioners. The &quot;artist&quot; is the machine, not them. <br>I send a lot of Work-in-progress and variations to my customers so they can check if everything is going according to how they want and they tell me to change a thing or mix another thing or try something different... and still, that doesn&#39;t really make them the artist. They are just still telling me what to do and I AM the one doing the work of changing the things.<br><br>When this tech initially popped up, I did mess a bit with it. I wanted to use it mostly to create backgrounds I could reference because I struggle with drawing backgrounds sometimes, but once I saw ALL the cons the technology has?? Nope, I completely dropped it.<br>AI tech bros don&#39;t realise that we, artists, are not against AI because we can also see how this can help us in our creative process by giving us ideas or aiding us in parts of our pieces, but we just want this tech to be ethical and our rights to be respected the same way the music industry&#39;s rights are. We don&#39;t want our labor to be exploited by AI companies, who are making a HUGE profit from these AI generators without giving the people they are exploiting their fair cut because &quot;they are too hard to track&quot; then maybe just don&#39;t use those images?? easy as that.<br>Tbh, a lot of the tech bros who use this just look like they hate the people their exploitative machine was made from. <br>&quot;Adapt or die&quot; they said... so we made data-poisoning tools to protect our work. And they complain for us adapting??? They just want to exploit us. <br>AI is a tool but just to an extent, because an artist can adapt to a different tool. I can draw both digitally and traditionally. The moment I drop my digital tablet I can pick up a pencil and paper and create work of similar quality to the digital one. <br>I have seen a very popular analogy: &quot;AI users who claim to be artists are like customers going to McDonalds, asking for a well-done BigMac without pickles and extra tomato and calling themselves a chef&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m a small artist. I had to registrate as a freelancer in my country, which doesn&#39;t have a percentage method for taxes, but a fixed number regardless of what you earn. And I have been in negative for months now.

I also found that often the safest times were when you were driving moderately aggressive, not allowing the bullies of the road to push their way in an out of lanes.   On a crowded freeway you were far safer going the speed the other cars around you even if that was over the posted speed limit.  Your brain made instant decisions of lane positioning to ensure that drivers in other lanes could see you and that you had a place to go if someone did something unexpected.  You would read a sign that says your lane is ending a mile ahead and know that if you get over too early, an entire string of very aggressive drivers will go around you in that ending lane only to have to push their way in ahead of you.  You would be punished for being responsible so you would find some compromise.   AI or self driving cars could make none of those decisions.  Your brain can add in so many gray factors and experiences instantly that a computer program could never emulate.  Cameras and sensors can only resolve pre-programmed inputs.

Needing to, at least in some way, figure out the actual creative process behind the creation of the source material. <br>Since the AI was trained on 100% of the pixel data, does it need to reverse engineer anything?

As much as AI art will help streamline certain things (like how I&#39;ve used it to help create cover art for an album, ep or single) I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll replace the feeling of creating a song from scratch, where you put all the elements together yourself. There&#39;s something special and fulfilling about completing an arrangement of a track that you won&#39;t be able to experience by using AI. It&#39;s like when you use a pre-made loop for a track and you know deep down that you didn&#39;t create that loop and it&#39;s just not that satisfying to use (not saying you can&#39;t use loops, I&#39;m just stating a valid point) vs compiling the drum patterns, chord progressions and melodies yourself. When you do everything yourself, it feels 100% like &quot;you&quot; which is what I think art is supposed to feel like from an independent artist. When a bigger project is compiled from multiple people, than that&#39;s different since you are putting multiple minds together to achieve a goal, but at least it&#39;s still human.🤷 😅",1

relevant,"There is a potential application that I doubt will ever replace humans but could really assist them in doing their jobs and that is assisting humans in performing complex maintenance procedures such as maintaining and aircraft and in particular an advanced fighter aircraft such as the F-16.<br><br>For example we are seeing that Ukraine is now getting block 15 F-16s from the Netherlands and Denmark and are having to train crews to maintain those aircraft. Thus one could imagine that if industry could develop an AI system focused on that one task that might help speed up that training as well as assist the new crews as they  come on line.<br><br>For their may be thousands of pages of tech manuals that they must gain some knowledge of to perform those task and thus the learning curve can be steep.<br><br>And unlike say in the US Air Force where there are senior  and experience technicians to train and supervise new ones Ukraine have no such senior technicians and thus might benefit from at least having an AI assistant to help them navigate all those complex procedures required to maintain an aircraft and assure that it is operating properly. <br><br>So the AI is not to replace the human but rather to help the human get up to speed in a more timely manner. For it takes about three years to become a seasoned maintainer and maybe AI can reduce that time say by a year.<br><br>BTW, I just made a video on this that goes into more details and uploaded it on my YouTube channel plus offered some thoughts on how one might go about building such an AI.",-1

Can you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your work?<br><br>AI artist: Hello, I&#39;m an AI artist, and I&#39;m excited to be here today. My work involves using artificial intelligence algorithms to generate creative content, including images, music, and even poetry.<br><br>Interviewer: That&#39;s fascinating. So, could you describe an art piece for us using AI language?<br><br>AI artist: Sure, I&#39;d be happy to. Let me generate a description of an art piece using my algorithms.<br><br>[AI takes a moment to process the image and generate a description]<br><br>AI artist: Here&#39;s my description of the art piece:<br><br>This artwork is a vibrant and colorful painting with a lively and energetic composition. The use of bold brushstrokes and vibrant hues creates a sense of movement and vitality, while the interplay of light and shadow adds depth and dimension to the piece. The central focus of the painting is a striking figure, rendered in bold lines and contrasting tones, which draws the viewer&#39;s attention and creates a sense of drama and tension. Overall, this painting is a dynamic and engaging work that captures the essence of the artist&#39;s creative vision.<br><br>Interviewer: Wow, that&#39;s impressive. How do you decide what language to use when describing an art piece?<br><br>AI artist: My algorithms analyze the visual features of the art piece and generate language based on the patterns and structures they detect. For example, if the painting has bold colors and brushstrokes, my algorithms may generate language that emphasizes the energy and movement of the piece. If the painting has a more subdued color palette and delicate lines, my algorithms may generate language that emphasizes the subtlety and grace of the work.<br><br>Interviewer: That&#39;s very interesting. Do you think AI-generated descriptions of art can enhance the viewer&#39;s experience of the artwork?<br><br>AI artist: Absolutely. AI-generated descriptions can provide a new perspective on the artwork and help viewers see the piece in a different light. By highlighting certain features of the artwork and drawing attention to elements that might otherwise go unnoticed, AI-generated descriptions can deepen the viewer&#39;s understanding and appreciation of the artwork.<br><br>Interviewer: That&#39;s a great point. Thank you so much for joining us today and sharing your insights with us.<br><br>AI artist: Thank you for having me. It was a pleasure.",1

relevant,"Ive just been watching videos on Auto-Play and it brings me back to this video. So I thought I might as well state a few questions to pose a perspective (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xJCzKdPyCo&amp;t=741"">12:21</a>) that this video prompted: Would you, or would you not sue someone for viewing your piece of art (in any form) and effectively integrating it into their understanding? [To sue would be like 1984 with the Thought Police]<br><br>I pose this question as its at the heart of discussion - regardless of how humans view content online, you wouldn&#39;t sue them for viewing your art -  whether it was legal or not. You would sue them for the end product of art that they produce that looks materially similar or illegally obtaining it (if found to be true via evidence). [That&#39;s Copyright]<br><br>What AI does could be considered transformative as the process is mutating the incoming data in similar ways to the brain to form latent embeddings that are distinct (in representation) from the input image. It may generate similar pieces of art, but I would argue that that has been achieved through hyper-focus - which fundamentally breaks the generalization of the underlying model. A human could generate a piece of art similar to yours if they viewed your artwork as well. From a functional point of view, the result is the same; created by two different viewers of the art work. So why is one criticized over the other? Why is the human perspective important here? <br><br><br>If the fundamental issue is that the business scraped your artwork from a site (on the internet), consider that the human viewer can also do that. Their functions are the same; regardless of scale. <br>In some ways, you are expecting protections on a medium that was never designed to give it. The internet was originally designed as an information sharing utility. To cry foul that that information is being used in a way you didn&#39;t expect is hardly justified given that context. Regardless of the possible backlash I may get on this next statement, understand it is a question more so than a statement:<br><br>Would you consider digital art worth less than the physical medium? If so, why? What about the physical media promotes higher costs (in the thousands) rather than the cheap costs (tens to hundreds) of the digital age? (Forget NFT&#39;s for this question, as its not a question of ownership).<br><br>Is it the very fact that it is a physical asset that gives it value? And if so, why do you care that a digital publication of the same artwork is being used to train this AI model? <br>Its fundamentally distinct from the real artwork piece- and in some ways being used in a transformational manner. As for digital art, it may have some intrinsic value as art - which I don&#39;t deny; but I do question what you thought was going to happen when you published it to a site like DeviantArt in whole. If you were about to protect your IP from infringement, wouldn&#39;t the best course of action be to release a partial or down-scaled version as proof and then keep the full resolution copy behind a paywall? <br><br>If you answer to the above question regarding digital artwork is &#39;because I wanted to share it&#39;, then you shouldn&#39;t be crying foul about AI using it; as you have achieved your purpose. If your answer was &#39;I wanted money to pay the bills&#39; - then why did you share it whole in the first place? Especially not behind a paywall. This could be considered negligence in some ways. <br><br>I hope I haven&#39;t offended too many people by these questions, and hope for some fruitful dialectical discussion.",1

This may be the case for young artists, aka children, but for a lot of artists in the community we stick to a lot of rules in order to be respectful of others&#39; art. For example, we may copy elements of an artists processes like colour, composition, or linework. These things are simply fundamentals of everyones art that everyone incorporates when making a piece of art. I hear non artists say a lot that we simply copy the whole art in order to learn but this is something that is very frowned apon in the art community and never acceptable. As artists we believe an individuals style is created by external elements like upbringing, culture and also other artists processes. All of these elements are what make another persons art unabled to be copied because it&#39;s unique in the way their brain and hand processef that information. In my opinion that&#39;s what makes art, art.

It just takes the prompt as written and generates an image based upon it - you don&#39;t get a DEI lecture if your prompt isn&#39;t &quot;on message&quot;.  <br><br>Of course there may be some bias inherent in the model which comes from the training data it has been fed - but this is going to be true of any AI model (and in some cases is actually desirable).

Is it learning to use new tools that remove the tedious parts of what we do, that benefit everyone including the weirdos that enjoy the tedious parts?

And letting more people create, not just create, but make amazing works of art and music in less time with less overall experience, while that seems good and would have seemed amazing when I started,  I think would kind of dilute art in general. At least from my experience the more I&#39;ve improved and learned, the more I understand what it actually takes to create. I&#39;ve found a greater appreciation for art and music and view it with so much more care and genuine interest then when I started.

However, the people providing their voices do at least see profit from the use of them, which could be a fair template for how voice-cloning models might work in the future. <br><br>Additionally even though the voices aren’t real, that means that there’s more emphasis on production in the vocaloid community, with different people having their own styles of “tuning” the voice, and vocaloid fans likely being able to name their favourite producers fairly easily. <br><br>Something like 愛して愛して愛して (Love me love me love me) by Kikuo wouldn’t work as a song remotely if the production and non-vocal elements weren’t well-crafted. Even if anyone can buy Hatsune Miku, not everyone could make a song like that. <br><br>Now, honestly, I think a lot of people getting invested in AI content nowadays are massive hacks who want to make money off of people more talented than them. But it is interesting to see where creative people will go with this technology, and I think the real success is probably going to be in joint human-AI collaboration.

If the artist&#39;s style is clearly used to train the machine learning model, then I think it should count as stolen art.

Why would anyone make anonymous elevator music or lofi-chillhop for youtubers if youtubers could ask an AI to make them 100 different versions until it got it just right? They wouldn&#39;t. So bedroom producers making simple instrumental tracks won&#39;t make money anymore. Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish and Ed Sheeran will keep making money because people care about them as people – they want to know what Ed Sheeran has on his mind. Same goes for virtuosos like Polyphia where we don&#39;t care how quickly a computer can &quot;play&quot; something, but seeing Tim Henson innovate on the guitar will make people chose Polyphia over AI every time. <br><br>I think the divide between album listeners and playlist listeners will grow, where playlist listeners won&#39;t care who made the music (if they ever did), whereas album listeners will care all the more.

Since this band in many people’s opinions was one of the greatest in the century of pop music and their harmonization combined with great melody lines and affectionate voices were one of a kind, I hope Gibb’s family allow creators to keep these brothers voices alive. Perhaps Gibb’s family / producer / engineer, etc. could endorse and help with refinements before releases. I think a lot of masters keep repeating their signature phrasings (more or less) so absorbing all that in the computer and using them intelligently is not far off from what the brain of artist would go through anyway. Although human gets hit by an occurrence that creates thoughts and emotions and the foundation of a song is based on that in a lot of cases so what computer is going to use to imitate that part of the process? There is an inevitable path of degradation in the music scene (of course that’s me growing up with 70s music) that I can’t explain to the younger generation but if I play 24 minutes of Supper’s Ready in 1977 Genesis Live to my daughter, she cannot imagine how such long track can satisfy her instant gratification need (unfortunately too impatient to see even a much bigger satisfaction if she would wait long enough).

IF i would want to live with africans.... i would live in africa instead and not germany, see where its going? i like african people and THEIR culture..but i also like my own. and i prefer to have people around me with similar values and mindsets and speaking the same language so you can actually talk to each other. <br><br>by making everything &#39;&#39;diverse&#39;&#39; you are making it less diverse. <br><br>as a kid, i was so thrilled every time we went on holiday somewhere to the world because every country was different, with different people and values, different music and food, different architecture and it was like you re visiting a whole different world. <br><br>now imagine you put diversity in there and every country is now the same. just a grey mudd instead of colors. france does not feel like france anymore, spain doesnt feel like spain anymore, germany doesnt feel like germany anymore and so on and so on. countries have no identity anymore, culture is slowly fading away. why would i want to visit x country if its the same stuff there as i have at home?<br><br>People are vastly different! and thats GOOD.  it doesnt mean however that alot of vastly different people should live together 24/7.<br>imagine you re renting a small room. and you put in 30 different people from 30 different countries speaking 30 different languages with 30 different values and political views and alike together into that single room but you only have 20 chairs in there...

I have to fully admit that I had a very difficult time watching through this video without getting frustrated, but a lot of the disagreements I had with you early on you managed to explain and ease the blow a little.<br><br>As an artist who has been developing my skills across various mediums for almost 20 years now - and who tries to just break even on the art I create - I understand that your video is simply about stating the facts, but it&#39;s a very - VERY - tough pill to swallow. Watching jobs that artists have spent decades working towards - illustration, graphic design, private commission work, etc. being replaced with AI practically overnight is ... horrifying, really. I understand that the average person doesn&#39;t mean any harm when using these programs, the average person is almost never willing to spend money on artists in the first place or pay them what they&#39;re worth - so of course the accessibility of AI art has huge appeal for people. (Even despite the glaring and often grotesque errors in what AI generates ... mangled hands and eyes, and proportions that don&#39;t make sense are all glossed over by most people it seems.) <br>I&#39;m glad that you tied your argument back to a lot of creative fields evolving and adapting over time - the comparison between traditional and digital art is not entirely inaccurate but I do have to argue that there is still a creative skill that is honed and developed in the transition between traditional and digital. You still have to DRAW on a tablet - and in the case of electronic music, you still have to PLAY and CREATE the composition - unlike with AI where you simple hit a button and the computer spits out the work for you.<br>I don&#39;t like how a lot of artists are jumping down peoples throats over this technology - it paints artists in a bad light and I wish there was a better way to express how scary this is and for the average person to understand in a clearer and more sympathetic light - your video is a step towards that ... but emotions are really high right now. It doesn&#39;t help that most artists never consented to their work being fed into these programs, so when we see AI generate these images with mangled signatures from the artwork they&#39;re &quot;inspired&quot; by ... it&#39;s hard not to get upset hearing your argument, &quot;It&#39;s creative freedom and it&#39;s the same as people using inspiration from other artists&quot;. It&#39;s not. Not yet, at least.<br><br>All of that said ... and as you conclude ... this is just something we need to live with now, unfortunately.

Consider that a 50/50 blend of Steve Perry and Paul Rodgers might result in a wholly new vocalist with an outstanding voice, Jon Anderson and Rod Stewart? Not a copy of anyone, but a voice no-one has heard before. Paul McCartney and Robin Gibb? Adele, Edith Piaf and Taylor Swift? etc., etc. Who knows what would sound good? Could be a combination of any number of voices. And since the original voices used for the blend would not have to be disclosed - the labels would be none the wiser. We may end up with record setting song sales by artists who do not actually exist. The successful blending of two or more voices into a new amalgam may prove to be a new art form all on it&#39;s own in the near future. As it becomes more sophisticated, you may be able to select for specific attributes: the range of Jon Anderson, the vibrato of Robin Gibb, the timbre of Chris Cornell, the phrasing of Louis Armstrong...the possibilities are actually infinite.<br>And by that point, live performance won&#39;t be an issue. You&#39;ll just need a good looking, charismatic performer who can hold a tune to generate the base vocal from, which the real time AI would turn into whatever fictional hybrid vocalist(s) you&#39;ve created. <br><br>While, admittedly, it would be less than ideal to be a singer under these circumstances, it should be considered that the amount of truly great singers in the world is quite small compared to the number of people trying to make music. For creators wanting to showcase their material in the best possible light, access to someone of the quality of a Stevie Wonder or a Pavarotti is pretty much a lost cause.

I think if Everyone got their own AI generator, and was only allowed to input to it, their own work, then any new art that it generated would be entirely from that artist and only THEN could they claim its still &quot;theirs&quot;. <br><br>Youtube strikes down videos with more than 5 seconds of &quot;copyrighted&quot; music, or copyrighted music &#39;performed by others&#39; that sounds very close to the original, but we&#39;re ok with AI generated stealing from thousands of copyrighted works?<br><br>OF course it &quot;saves the company money&quot;.

relevant,"I am both of a more artistic and &quot;programmer&quot; like mindset, I absolutely agree with you, even human beings are as drone like as the AI if they are career artists. Living in the fast paced, work driven world like we do these days, most artists just don&#39;t have the privilege to create from their heart or soul, not as much at least. Most of us, if we want to keep spending our time working with art, we must conform to the desires of the many and client based &quot;products&quot;, we create for the desire of others and what they want. In these cases, it&#39;s not always what we want to make naturally, or even like at all, but we do it because working all the time takes us away from being able to create for ourselves, to express ourselves. I don&#39;t know about everyone else and other artists, but I can definitely feel the difference between creating out of necessity for work related, product related purposes, vs creating out of passion, and necessity to express our self. I&#39;m sure programmers must feel this way as well, for example, putting their hearts into creating ai, because they love it, because they are passionate to see where this technology goes, the progress. <br>Because I&#39;ve felt this on a programmer like level, I understand why they want to defend AI so much, to them, this is a passion for them, their own art. I also really appreciate AI, because I know the self that can go into programming, and seeing the progress. I think this video helped me realize that more, too.<br> <br>I love the idea you have for artists to have their own AI&#39;s. There is so much already out there right now artists are using as a tool that make the process so much faster and more efficient. Digital art; now you don&#39;t need to buy paints, you can send them quickly online over the internet, print them out. Using photography instead of life drawing to get the references your want or need for a piece. There&#39;s even great tools online, like picrew, where the artist can put parts of an artwork on different layers, using all the same poses, backgrounds, other assets, to create literally thousands of different possibilities very quickly, in their own art style. Dress up games in general. 3D art, you create something once, and can duplicate it easily for another project. Undo button, copy, flip, rotate, on digital canvases, all are just ways to make the process run easier and more smoothly. Some artists still insist on traditional art mediums, that&#39;s fine for them, but even they use tricks and other tools to make the process run quicker and smoother, stencils, sponges, stamps, printmaking. Traditional animation, cel animation, digital animation, 3D animation...<br><br>Right now using AI is seen as wrong because ease always seems wrong to those who have had to work harder in the past, and think that working harder is a more valuable asset, but the fact is, when you streamline the extra legwork from the past, you have more time and energy to think of something new and novel that could bring even more amazing results as time runs on.<br><br>Along with your idea, I really think it might be possible to at least do licensing, or even royalties, if an AI company wants to use a gallery of an artist&#39;s work. If they are grabbing galleries from others, they can put the bit of extra effort in getting the artist on board with the project. Not all artists will be able to understand how to use ai to be self reliant for that business, but they entities that do know AI should still ethically get the proper permissions from the artists before entering it as part of the AI.. Of course, I don&#39;t know enough about how the AIs are programmed to know if that&#39;s possible, but if it is, it should be possible for artists to take legal action if they find their work being so easily replicated just by a user inputting their name and style attached.<br><br>I think it can be done, but the legal system is so slow...<br>At least word of mouth and people respecting individual rights is something until it gets to people that don&#39;t care and will do it anyway.. ^^&#39;&#39; But that happens every day right now.

relevant,"AI generative art is a tool, like a paintbrush or any other tool. If you paint or trace an exact copy of any art, you will be guilty of plagiarism. If you use ai tools to build custom models and transform a piece of art within a greater workflow, and the result is ultimately unique and original, even with a few notes sampled from another artist, that is still art. Each individual work needs to be judged on its own merits, not by how similar the styles may be. Personality and individual expression will always need to be a primary factor, but every artist is free to use any tool they wish, and this will be true forever. The best and most influential AI artists of the future will be those that are most original, and do the work to build their own unique models that express their own unique styles. AI artists will benefit most from sharing their influences and workflows openly with their community and other artists to collaborate to build tools that make it easier to build custom styles.",1

If you’re struggling with a pose or perspective, you can trace something to figure out how to do it yourself, but you don’t claim it’s yours. If you do post it, you cite your source, just like a bibliography for a book report. AI has learned from artists and is now profiting from other people’s art, claiming it to be original. It specifically erases the watermarks of the art it has stolen. The problem is that AI is only good at reference. It can’t think critically. If you give it an abstract concept like “really scary thing” it can’t invent something new, it can only reference other scary things. The same thing would happen if an alien race landed on Earth and you asked AI to draw it. It couldn’t because it doesn’t have that alien in its database to reference. AI art is basically just a personalized google images. It’s fine if you want to goof around with it, but I don’t think you should give it any more credit than it deserves. It’s not amazing art, it’s referencing amazing art and mashing it all together. Stop and think, “how much would it cost to pay an artist to do this for me with much more tact and specificity?” I dunno, just some things to keep in mind.

relevant,"I totally disagree with that comparison that you do between how an AI &quot;learns&quot; to draw and how a human artist gets inspired. That comparison is incomplete, misleading and totally dishonest. Please stop propagating that fake metaphor.<br><br>You said a human artist can get inspired by the work of others and give hir own touch. You then say that this &quot;should not be considered stealing&quot;. OK I agree, but the reasons why most of the people would not consider that this is stealing are two:<br><br>1 - The human artist would be adding HIS OWN TOUCH. (unlike an AI).<br><br>2 - That process would require a significant amount of human effort and certain innate talent that not everyboady is capable of. That skill and has merit. If an artist is capable of painting by hand a copy of the mona lisa that an art expert considers almost identical from the original, that artist would be praised for his insane skill. No one would say that his work is &quot;unoriginal&quot; and nobody would say that what he has done is similar to taking a picture of the original painting. Reproducing art requires skill, and what artist do when they replicate art from others is practicing to gain skill.<br><br>3 - That process require time. Human time is limited, if someone decides to go to art school and learn art, that person is investing a significant amount our his life in gaining that skill that allows him to output from his imagination beautiful creations. The goal of the artist is to invest a portion of his life to leave in the world something unique.<br><br>4 - Also a human artist can learn from the work of others, but he can learn without seeing someone else&#39;s work, just by getting inspired by his life experience or his imagination. Human art geniuses have jumped from their mundane life experience to wonderful creations new to the world.<br><br><br>But an AI image generator.<br><br>1 - Can not add its own touch, because it has no own touch, it has no life experience, no conciousness, no thougts or feelings. All it has is a huge dataset of work from human artists. That dataset is all it knows, every single relationship &quot;word -- configuration of shapes&quot; comes from that dataset, without that dataset (someone else&#39;s work) the AI would not even draw a stickman.<br><br>2 - Unlike the human artist, for the AI, there is no skill requirement. Because the AI goes from pixels to pixels, copy-paste. I know its not exactly copy-paste, but if a human had to imitate what an AI image generator does, processing thousands of images at a pixel level,  we won&#39;t be saying &quot;its getting inspired&quot;, we would be saying &quot;its doing a photocopy&quot;. From day 0 the AI can copy-paste perfectly.<br><br><br>3 - For an AI, the time required to learn is several orders of magnitude smaller. The amount of images that the AI can process is several orders of magnitude above what a human person can experience in his life. What if AI image generators were limited to a human scale the output would not be that good. This is important, because this huge amount of images processed is what turns this process of enhaced copy-pasting at a pixel level, into something that some people consider &quot;original creations&quot;. Those are not &quot;original&quot; and those are not &quot;creations&quot;, everything was previously in the dataset.<br><br>4 - How would be an AI that learns to draw without the dataset? The day that this happens, this would deserve to be called AI Art. But today there is no such a thing.<br><br>Please stop doing the comparison &quot;the AI is doing&quot;  what a human does: getting inspired by the work of others. Reverse the reasoning: imagine a human processing pixels by hand and inserting them in identical patterns. <br><br>Or just do an AI, that looks to the world, and learns how to move its mechanical arm, and to use a pencil, and to use a brush and paint. Go this way.",-1

relevant,"I&#39;m not the biggest champion of self-driving cars, but I think way too much of the conversation is sensational rather than inquisitive and informative. It&#39;s easy enough to find a few silly situations to ridicule, but I don&#39;t think the news reporting we are getting will age very well. At the rate things are developing, it seems likely that self-driving cars will be safer than the average human driver relatively soon. Now that they are considered safe enough to operate and learn in a live environment, they will evolve even faster. We shouldn&#39;t let these companies get away with murder, but it doesn&#39;t seem like they are trying to. Seems to me like they are just trying to do their best in a somewhat dismissive (and sometimes outright hostile) media environment. Progress is inevitable, and in the case of self-driving cars, perhaps mostly for the better. At least if we take it seriously enough to prepare for it. There will probably not be much need for human drivers in the future, and it&#39;s important no to stick our heads in the sand and pretend that isn&#39;t going to happen.<br><br>If we look at the history of automation though, the most likely way this will play out is something like this:<br><br><b>Yesterday:</b> <i>What do you mean self-driving cars? Don&#39;t be silly! That is total science fiction and will never actually happen.</i><br><b>Today:</b> <i>Look at all those silly autonomous cars! They can only drive as well as a human 99% of the time, and sometimes they stop for no apparent reason.

Whould it be able to create an end to end app that uses micro services, work loads, docker and k8s integrations and deploy to aws for example? An app that has complicated logic and complicated ui? How many iteration will that app require for gpt-pilot to complete?

How will the AI be able to handle niche areas of programming, such as adobe extensions for example(I am developing extensions for living and while gpt and copilot help me develop extension, they do a lot of errors and I assume it has something to do with the fact that there are not that many of repos on GitHub for this set of problems I.e. automating adobe tools)<br> And how will they test the extension if it requires to run in a closed environment?<br>Thanks a lot for your videos!

Paradoxically, it&#39;s usually the <i>product-driven</i> artists that were the most upset. The value of art as a process is a also an emotional one, and ultimately what drives an artist forward. The product is the destination and does also have layers of value and meaning beyond just its monetary aspect. But that actually goes for AI-generated art and the atmosphere it creates by capturing the unique nature of a particular style. There are few words that have such a contested definition as the word &quot;art&quot;. (&quot;Love&quot;, perhaps) I can see why there is such a huge debate about whether &quot;AI Art&quot; meets some of these definitions, like an author&#39;s self-expression that&#39;s not given by something that&#39;s generated by an algorithm. Yet there is also a common notion that there is no actually original art, and what differentiates plagiarism from professional art is knowing how to steal from many different sources. In fact, some of the same artists that now talk about AI just stealing art argued about precisely that. (As the book titled &quot;Steal Like an Artist&quot; suggests, which I actually found through a YouTube artist recommendation)<br><br>  <br><br>And as you mentioned at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o09F6TViIGk&amp;t=615"">10:15</a>, plagiarism is about <i>the person</i> falsely claiming work as their own. Whether that be an actual artist, or - In the case of AI art - the owners behind the technology. Don&#39;t demonize the tool - blame the user.  <br><br>In that regard, AI basically taps into more sources of artworks as reference to create an images than any real person ever could. Of course there is a more unique conversion and perception when an actual person converts their reference material. But the technology is not actually taking any one artwork and selling it as theirs.<br><br>  <br><br>That said, using the images without consent <i>is</i> an issue, as you pointed out at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o09F6TViIGk&amp;t=545"">9:05</a>.<br><br>Thankfully, opt-out options are at least popping up that allow artists from excluding their art. But while Opt-out could still be considered a crummy approach (and laws in the future might even make this outright illegal) that ultimately won&#39;t prevent AI art to reach a level where it can meet the vast majority of art commissions.<br><br>  <br><br>I think the real issue is the underlying fear through the sudden shift in the art market, as noted by you at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o09F6TViIGk&amp;t=663"">11:03</a>. Suddenly, technology made it possible to create art styles that previously required hours of work - let alone years of practice to hone that skill. So I can see why full-time artists are so upset right now. Particularly the less professional ones (as there is no target group left for them, losing to both cheap and clean-looking AI art that the average joe is content with, and not being able to keep up with the pros providing refined and expensive hand-crafted art for the connoisseurs.)<br><br>  <br><br>They now meet the fate that many jobs were previously done manually and lost to automation. Art was considered this bastion that computers and automation were for the longest time impossible to touch, but now suddenly reached a dumbfounding level of proficiency in the blink of an eye. Making a living as an artist now definitely got harder. But in magical wonderland where money is not a issue and merely becoming a good artist and enjoying the process is the goal, the situation actually got a lot better.<br><br>Because ironically, It&#39;s never been easier to create reference material to practice drawing specific objects, compositions, drawing styles or color palettes than before.<br>But as you implied at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o09F6TViIGk&amp;t=676"">11:16</a>, this is a blessing for the society at large by making art products far more accessible than ever before.<br><br>For the consumer.<br>For the hobbyist painter.<br>And even for the <i>nonvisual artist</i> that previously had no budget for enhancing their work of writing or music with pictures, this is a win/win situation.",1

For comparison, the tool you looked at (jukebox) was made basically as an junior project in 2020 with probably under a week training time. There is no serious corporate attempt to tackle AI composition.<br><br>The reason for this is simply that there isn&#39;t much demand for generated music compared to audio.<br><br>If you want generic music to fit a specific vibe, we already have a mountain of license free music.

irrelevant,"Everyone loves to trash it, but the Spanish Inquisition was the first tribunal that institutionalized legal representation. The process REQUIRED the defendant to have an attorney and was assigned one if he couldn&#39;t find one himself. It was the process with more safeguarding for the defendant at that point in history.<br><br>The Inquisition was also part of the efforts to unify Spain, a newly formed kingdom at the time, that was trying to bring under one King and Queen one of the territories most prone to civil war in history. I think the USA is now realizing what the Egyptians clearly saw: single faith empires are the ones that last. Like it or not, that&#39;s been proven many times.<br><br>As famous as the Inquisition is for its death penalty sentences, it only applied &quot;torment&quot; to 2% of the defendants in 3 and a half centuries of trials (around 3000 dead in 340 years, &quot;torment&quot; was the term for any type of torture). Death penalty was frequently avoided by just repenting. Between the XVI and XVIII centuries, more than 50000 &quot;witches&quot; were killed in other parts of Europe by the Calvinist (I don&#39;t have the tortured numbers, but they frequently went together), most of them in Germany, while only 59 women were burned by the Inquisition. And you can read more about some of the Spanish cases because they are well recorded, some might not have been &quot;witches&quot;, but were accused of atrocities that might have no better name.<br><br>These are not just history facts I like to write to show off. I&#39;m not even very well educated on them. These are FACTS that have been hidden and rewritten by the English speaking world and repeated by other Spanish enemies because at one point in history, Spain was the largest empire the world has seen. Being born in a country that has perpetrated these lies and still insists on desecrating any Spanish legacy in your continent, you should know very well how the tactics worked and understand that they are now being used against your empire.",0

relevant,"It&#39;s all about the &#39;&#39;Human Connection&#39;&#39;. As a singer/songwriter myself, just listening to all of what Rick&#39;s talking about and projecting it in a very near future is just heartbreaking and gut-wrenching. He is so right when he talks about the evolution of technology in the music production. I remember recording on a 4 track Tascam cassette tape back 30 years ago and then digital devices swept the whole analog realm in just a couple of years. Just like the AI revolution or more precisely an evolution on a whole different level because AI was already helping out with VST instruments and DAWs like Cubase or Protools for example 20 years back.<br><br>When it comes to AI in music, it&#39;ll be there to stay and I have no clue how far it&#39;ll go and what the music business is gonna look like, but I know that a whole bunch of people will like it, will care at certain levels and won&#39;t at other levels. <br><br>I&#39;m old school on all of this when it come to music whether I compose music and write songs or listen and experience the music of other artists. One thing I know, I will encourage and stay true to my core values, and I will prefer buying real music made by real artists, real human voices and real songwriting even though I have to admit that even nowadays sometimes it&#39;s be hard to know how much &#39;&#39;real&#39;&#39; there is in the end product I hear.<br><br>Just like Elton John was saying in an interview a couple years back on what advice he had for the new generation of artists and the whole streaming thing and how to make money and live off from your music, he said &#39;&#39;It&#39;s really becoming insane and a lot of young emerging artists go viral or get on billboard charts with only one song and they get high on that but it&#39;s so fleeting. If you want to last in this business especially now, do live concerts and keep on doing it more than ever before. You can&#39;t copy a concert ticket or download a live gig experience.&#39;&#39;<br><br>To me, the one fundamental thing about this whole AI Sh** is that it cannot reproduce in any way shape or form the &#39;&#39;human connection&#39;&#39;. We long for human connection naturally in every aspect of life. With the help of humans programming AI, it could maybe get to a certain level of &#39;&#39;understanding&#39;&#39; and display a sort of &#39;&#39;Autotuned Empathy&#39;&#39;. Nowadays, the concept of empathy is so popular with growing narcissistic societies. But the concept of sympathy is fading out or isn&#39;t the trend right now and this IS the ultimate level, let&#39;s say, where AI could not reach cause if you ask your friends or anybody around you what is the difference between empathy and sympathy, don&#39;t be surprised of the answers you hear. <br><br>Lyrics in a song can bring you to a place of understanding or getting the big picture behind the meaning of the song. A sort of empathy arises, a comprehension of the storytelling. But music on the other hand, will &#39;&#39;enhance&#39;&#39; or color and bring the lyrics, the story to that level of beauty like sugar-coating and make you discover flavours you had not expected or experienced before.<br><br>Only this song has that taste let’s say. It&#39;s a sad song because of the lyrics obviously but the music shows you the degree of sadness of that song. Music is on the level of sympathy while lyrics sides more with empathy.<br><br>Empathy is like putting yourself in the shoes of someone and getting a certain idea or concept of what that person is going through. Just like in the medicine field, they teach doctors about empathy instead of sympathy with their patients because they say it could be harmful for the doctor if he bonded and had this friendly or human connection and transfer with a patient dying of cancer for example. <br><br>AI would be the best ones to prevent sympathy and really stick to empathy. But a doctor, an artist, a music fan, all of them are human beings with emotions first. We can&#39;t separate that from us. <br><br>Sympathy is not trying to understand what this person is going through right now and trying to help or find solutions for the person&#39;s burden. Sympathy is sharing that burden, taking half of it let&#39;s say so that the person can have a better chance at getting back up on its feet. Sympathy is suffering with the person and doing something about it. Empathy is easier or less demanding because it&#39;s more on a level of understanding how big the burden is and sending flowers and prayers for a quick recovery! <br><br>Lyrics can bring you to tears or make you feel any types of emotions but music is that extended part where you will reach another level of a song. Sometimes we experience music and cry, or we feel something so strong inside of us and if a person asks you why this song has that effect on you, you can&#39;t give a precise answer as to why that particular song strikes a cord in you and you&#39;ll end up saying well maybe it&#39;s the chord progression or the sounding of a certain instrument, a melody beautifully intertwined with the harmony and lyrics on top of it or it reminds me of a certain period of my life even though the lyrics are not related to that period...<br>It&#39;s just the music...they&#39;re landmarks.<br>I don&#39;t think that AI will reach that level of emotional intelligence.

I think we need a specifically trained hierarchy of models that perform all the steps of the development chain and send instructions to improve upon the development cycle, with human influence. I think it will be: humans creating ecosystems, and those ecosystems interacting with other ecosystems of software stacks and LLM models maintaining them. Humans will be assigned to validation of theory, because we are the original source of creativity. The seed of random for the LLMs would come from the /dev/urandom of the universe. Brute force trial and error with LLMs, but humans would become knowledge workers of another kind, heading towards biologically invasive integration. The LLMs will converse with each other to brute force the problems we come up with. But, humans are impatient, and we won&#39;t stop modifying our own LLM systems, so then it will not become autonomous but rather just the most useful tool in our repertoire.",-1

You can sit with them and generate AI art so they can visibly see their concept. Then you spend a day or two recreating the pieces of the puzzle they wanted in your own art style. This is an hour with the bot and a few days of art. Whereas before it might have taken you 2-3 days to come up with a concept only for the customer to say &quot;nah..

The AI trends you discuss put specific focus on a couple of levels I&#39;d like to share from my experience with English language no-code tools from the late1970&#39;s to the present day.  Entry level skills that need to be built from elementary school levels are critical thinking, and operational system analysis ( use case domain driven ) .  Then learning to build prompt syntax excellence within the boundaries of specific LMs  that are trained on data aligned with specific use cases.  Example - we are experts in the SME manufacturing space.  The manufacturing domain results in manufacturing an English language domain variant that can be easily used to train an LM.  Today - this challenge is the easy part.  The hard part today is getting code delivered with UI-UX that is more sophisticated delivering what you need to see and do &quot;in 3 clicks or less&quot; on multiple devices.  And yes even that standard of UI-UX design can be taught as patterns to an LM.  Rock on!",1

But with this, there&#39;s literally not a single ounce of respect or effort. There&#39;s no thought being put into what made the art style so unique, what makes it so memorable, how much work it takes to replicate it. It sees the artwork as nothing more than another picture you can find in a magazine and, in a few seconds, pops out a copy. It lacks the most important aspect of what makes art art, the soul.

relevant,"I will say that I think the sampling argument is actually a good one to make, only, it happens at a level that&#39;s much more granular than music sampling is so we don&#39;t recognize it as such. Like, for example, if I took an entire picture, put tracing paper over it, and traced it, and called it my picture, we&#39;d obviously cry foul at that. What if, instead, I took someone&#39;s picture of a face, and then traced the outline of their head. Then I took someone else&#39;s picture of a face, and traced the eyes from that. Then someone else for ears, someone else for a nose, so on and so on. At that level, the &quot;sampling&quot; argument is super easy to see, right? Like if you knew the source images, you&#39;d see the eyes and be like, &quot;no way, you didn&#39;t draw this, this is from dippopoccomucus&#39;s anime girl drawing.&quot;<br><br>I could repeat that process, but trace a little less. One picture I only trace the outline of a jaw, then another picture I trace the cheeks, and on and on again. Surely I&#39;m creating something that borders on being a cryptid, but, we&#39;d still recognize it as being sampling. What AI like stable diffusion are doing is essentially this practice, but in much smaller chunks. Sometimes single line strokes, maybe just a splash of color, even if it&#39;s just a little gradient. It&#39;s capable of adjustments to copy-pasted stuff, that makes it less copy-pastey. It can internally categorize things enough to have certain lines be categorized almost like different brush strokes, and so maybe one of the things it does is trace a line using a different type of stroke. Both the line and the stroke themselves were sampled, too, it just categorizes things well enough that it is able to pattern-match and interchange things that are compatible. <br><br>A simple example is like, if you used the prompt, &quot;Yoda, but he&#39;s purple&quot;, it would be fairly easy for it to see the keyword of &quot;purple&quot;, have it categorized as a color, know which pictures were categorized with Yoda, be able to tell that the primary color in those pictures was green, which is also a color, and then do a swap. Probably end up with a purple tree in the background too. If you were to take a random picture of Yoda, photoshop him purple, and sell it as your OC Groda (do not steal), again, we&#39;d call foul. But take that exact process and distill it into tinier chunks, and that&#39;s what the AI is doing.<br><br>It&#39;s easy to anthropomorphize AI, especially since we call the training process &quot;learning&quot;, saying things like, &quot;it knows what Yoda looks like&quot;, &quot;It knows what purple is&quot;, stuff like that, but it&#39;s important to remember that it doesn&#39;t KNOW shit. It doesn&#39;t understand the concept of Yoda (not that any of us do, really), it just knows that that word seems to be related to a ton of pictures that have a lot of similar imagery, and it can then categorize those all together, and heck, once it&#39;s got the criteria for what &quot;Yoda&quot; maps to, it can even pick out other pictures in the set that are also likely pictures of &quot;Yoda&quot; even if they&#39;re not tagged as such. A troll doll or two might sneak in there, so it wouldn&#39;t be unthinkable to see an AI give you a purple Yoda with super tall hair, but at the end of the day it&#39;s just making millions of these categorizations and, even if only on a tiny level, is just putting stuff together in a way that it roughly matches the categorizations you specified.<br><br>This is mostly a simplified version of any AI process, rather than just Stable Diffusion itself. I&#39;m less familiar with what exactly stable diffusion is doing, but from what I can gather, it takes existing images, flattens them into what it&#39;s able to understand as basic/similar components (the computer version of us saying &quot;oh this is a picture with a house and some trees), adds a bit of staticy randomness to it called noise, then does a similar process in reverse with a little more randomness to create a new image. The reversing process can be adjusted on the fly with whatever text prompts you added (ie., it&#39;s reversing this process on a picture of yoda, but this is the stage where it takes all the &quot;green data&quot; and makes it purple instead). The pictures and properties of pictures that it takes all follow the logic I was talking about for all AI, and then to actually make the picture itself, it&#39;s just this collapsey-staticy-destaticy-decollapsey process. If that&#39;s so, then it explains why sometimes evidence of signatures pop up in the ai-generated images - it&#39;s taking an existing image, and just applying the world&#39;s most high-tech blur tool to it.<br><br>This comment got way bigger than I expected and at this point I&#39;m making it mostly for me, but, the tl;dr is that I don&#39;t think the sampling argument should be dismissed out of hand, just because it&#39;s only sampling at a computer-obvious level rather than at a human-obvious one. I can&#39;t make any moral judgements on the AI itself, all work is derivative and even my youtube comment is somehow derived from the Epic of Gilgamesh. But I think that there&#39;s a little more merit to the theft argument than may be immediately apparent, and that the process could be considered much closer to copy-pasting with the blur tool on than just &quot;taking inspiration from&quot; existing work.",-1

relevant,"Hi :) these questions are interesting to ask ourselves. <br><br>I want to add a distinction between the law of copyrights and ethical dilemmas as two separate entities (even if closely interlinked). <br><br>Copyrights differ from country to country and most people aren&#39;t knowledgeable about them. By law - at least in the UK and most European countries - you cannot sell fanart legally. You would have to pay a license to use or buy the copyrights. Many people who sell fanart either do so because they are unaware of the copyright laws and therefore unaware of the risk they are taking (of being found and asked to pay royalties) or they are aware and are choosing to behave against the law (i.e. theft). A style doesn&#39;t fall under copyright laws, same for stick figure type of creations. Collages are difficult under copyright laws and quite complex. <br>Copyrights also apply to pictures taken of art. For instance, you technically cannot post a picture you have taken of a painting still protected by copyright without obtaining the rights of the painting&#39;s copyright owners first. It may be okay only if it&#39;s part of the background: let&#39;s say you were taking a photo of your friend at the pub and there happens to be a painting in the decor. <br>Furthermore, copyright also applies to alteration made to the artwork without consent which challenges the right to integrity of the work. This is important because it can protect the artist from derogartory misuse, e.g., you could create a portrait and that image could be used by someone who then adds offensive symbols to it, denaturing the artwork&#39;s original intent. <br><br>Most people also think, because of social media, that they can post pictures and videos freely without concerns about copyrights. In reality, you should obtain the consent of the people present in the images. If a person sees themselves in a video or photo you have posted, they have every right to ask you to remove it under copyright laws. <br><br>(Memes are an interesting copyright debate by the way).<br><br>Hence, with AI, under copyright law (and not ethical questioning), if the app uses images in its database to create something new without prior consent, it is theft as it is using artwork without the creator&#39;s consent and potentially affecting the right to integrity of the artist and its work. <br>From an ethical point of view though, there lies the debate. That debate is therefore not necessarily on AI but on copyrights in general. Such as, when should copyright applies? When do we believe we cross a line? How do we judge intent? How do we protect creators without limiting the community from getting inspired by one another? Etc.<br><br>However, people who share their photos to use the app, may not have read the terms and conditions and/or may have given full royalty of their own copyright (photography copyrights are automatically assigned to the person who took the picture) or accepted a license to use (most likely) without being properly informed of what it means. That is an other important ethical dilemna. Agreeing to a license to use without being informed about how copyright works and what it entails, could mean that people may have given consent for their image to be used by the app by other users. It could result in people having no protection and no support from the app if their image ends up being used for propaganda work that goes against their values, illegal pornographic images or any sorts of images the person may not want to be linked to. <br><br>Among visual artists, the common practice that we have judged ethical is to credit the artist when sharing their work, when doing fan art or when creating something heavily influenced by them. Maybe AI apps could include that in their coding somehow. Who knows?<br><br>Thanks for opening a discussion, sorry for this long a** essay 😬🤓",-1

People often underestimate the trade-off between abstraction and efficiency; coding won&#39;t disappear entirely because of this. Additionally, AI is incredibly energy-intensive. I&#39;m unable to make the maths on my own, but the amount of energy it would take to replace all the traditional software in use today with AI systems should not be overlooked.

So really, is it just the output that matters? Are we actually losing skills when we use AI, or is it simply another way to mass produce moderately quality stuff while lacking the skill required to produce it? Personally, I&#39;m pro AI, and I really appreciate being able to create music without requiring the skill for it because music is NOT my main passion/focus and is more of a side hobby. It helps me experiment around with different things and lets me get to the end goal (i.e. making a song) a lot faster than if I don&#39;t use AI. Although I can&#39;t help but draw a connection between this and everything else that&#39;s mass produced in the world.

The chair you sit in, the car you drive, the speakers on your desk, plastic sports trophies and the ugly concrete state buildings downtown — everything boring and tremendous in the world has a designer, and that&#39;s a LOT of artists at work. <br>I feel AI largely removes not only soul or passion individually from the artist, but from those who would buy their art or lend any audience to it. It must be realized and appreciated that the real world puts us all in the day-to-day situation of wanting purpose, and an artist feels no differently. A bare fraction of us get to work on the art that drives us or feeds our souls on a constant basis, and often we need to just do what we must to survive. AI doesn&#39;t just threaten to interrupt a hobby, it potentially takes jobs and livelihoods away, and no matter what you do for a living it wears at the spirit when you feel you might have lost your place.<br>In the meantime I hope we all keep working on what we want to, as much as we can, in spite of things feeling watered down",-1

relevant,"What a great video. love it! <br>My two cents on AI and art is that I think we should be a bit careful with sayings like &quot;The AI will never as creative as humans or AI can never match a human&#39;s creative process&quot;. <br>There are strong indications that humans&#39; learning processes are exactly same as AIs at the base level. The current difference is that the AIs that we are seing around is &quot;Narrow AIs&quot; which are trained to do one certain task and deliver one single objective. <br>We possess &quot;General Intelligence&quot; similar to &quot;General AI&quot;, .we learn from information and experiences we have and convert them into art we create. Compared to the Narrow AI which doesn&#39;t have the broad range of experiences and information that we have. <br>Now the dilemma starts when we have a general or near general AI and it is able to create &quot;better than human&quot; art from its own experiences. Which is quite likely as AI can literally experience hundreds or thousands of year of information and live through it. <br>If we define our art being superior to and more creative than AI, I am afraid this would lead to disappointment when the general AI arrives. <br>I think beauty of Art is in its indivuduality. The certain experiences and certain emotions that we have lead to a certain reflection of an art, which is truly unique to its creator. And this is what makes each art piece unique and valuable.

We eventually learn to trust our audience when they say &quot;holy shit! Two cakes!&quot;<br>But the existential dread doesn&#39;t ever fully neutralize. It scabs over and eventually scars, but it&#39;s still a sore spot.

relevant,"Nobody outside of artists and people wasting more time than they should on analyzing somebody else art cares about an art piece&#39;s journey. Nobody that watched Endgame cared about all the VFX artists that were overworked making it. Nobody who can&#39;t afford a 3 million dollar paining is going to care about it. Nobody cares about how overworked animators are in Asia - hell, most people in the west don&#39;t even know most of the cartoons they watch are storyboarded in the west but animated in the east.<br><br>As for artists, they need to realize something very important, your painting isn&#39;t worth what you say it&#39;s worth. It&#39;s worth what people are willing to pay for it. If people aren&#39;t willing to pay you enough for your work for you to make a living that&#39;s not their problem, that&#39;s your problem. There&#39;s a reason most historical art was either made in service of something or someone else. A monk that illuminated a manuscript had a monastery to support him. A knife maker that carved an intricate handle was selling the blade first and foremost. Michelangelo did no paint the Sistine chapel, the papacy hired him to paint it. And things were not much different in the east. Most art produces in the east came from those rich enough to have the time to waste on making art and writing poems. Most people in the past, just like know, don&#39;t really care about art. Art is something we consume, not something we analyze. I remember in school, we used to analyze poems and I always hated it. Not because I wasn&#39;t good at it but because it felt like we were putting words in the mouths of mostly dead people. The poet already wrote what the wanted to. Trying to find meaning, especially when your a century or more removed from his death is pointless. It&#39;s an exercise in futility. An extremely political poem satirizing someone might be read completely differently without the historical context it was written in, and for most people, they will never be exposed to that historical context. The work must stand on it&#39;s own. And that right there is the problem with your argument. For most people, how a work was composed and made matter not. For the artists, the art historian, the art critic,? Yes, for those categories it matter. But for Joe average who&#39;s just looking at a nice painting and who will forget 90% of it the moment he walked/clicked away? No. And it&#39;s the same for corporations. Any studio exec that cares about the artists under his employ will probably not get very far. A POS like Weinstein on the other hand? he&#39;s made more successful movies than most Hollywood producers put together. Why? Because they were just products he was good finding a clientele for and advertising to said clientele.<br><br>Art is a product. Not because I say so but because everybody outside artists treats it as such, and because artists treat it as such whenever they want to eat. These AIs do nothing different that what an artists might do. All this flowery talk about emotions and feelings is all nice and good, until you realize the whole point of an animation departmental is for each and every artist working there is to draw just like the person next to them. Once the character sheet is complete, you don&#39;t get to deviate from it, not if you want to still be able to afford rent and food at the end of the month. Most artists get payed to not be original. To not draw what they want or how they feel. They get payed to slowly go insane drawing imperceptibly small variants of the same character or scene over and over again. AI is going to put all those people out of work. It&#39;s also going to put story bord and concept artists out of work. It&#39;s basically going to put anyone and everyone that&#39;s making products that falls under the art category out of work. If your art isn&#39;t a product then you have nothing to worry about since the AI won&#39;t be able to replace everything you bring to every individual work of art. The fact that artists all over are going insane over AI art and accusing it of doing exactly what they did, learn from previous artists, seems to indicate most artists are fully aware they&#39;re making products and al this over-analyzing crap is nothing but nice packaging.<br><br>And to any artists still reading, please remember that most successful authors aren&#39;t successful because they&#39;re good, they successful because they never gave up where more talented people did. In the world of AI art it will be up to you to convince people your &quot;subpar&quot; human art is worth their time. There will probably be people willing to do it for you, for a fee, but you need to realize, you&#39;re still selling a product at the end of the day and if people aren&#39;t willing to pay you for it, then it&#39;s not worth what you think it is. Also, maybe, just maybe, don&#39;t give your art away for free on DeviantArt. It&#39;s hard to make people pay for what they can get for free. Not to mention that giving your art away for free is how the AI models got fed. You might have had to visit museums to learn from previous generations, Midjourney just needed to go to DeviantART. If an AI is trained on your art the problem isn&#39;t that you didn&#39;t give permission - your permission is as irelevant as that of the masters you saw in the museum - it&#39;s that your art was easily available for the AI researchers to feed into the machine.

For the rest, AI will outcompete artists by being cheaper.<br>I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s plagiarizing to AI generate &quot;art&quot; in the style of a human artist. You could just as well pay an artist to copy the style of another artist, and it&#39;s still a separate creation. The only difference is that now it&#39;s cheaper. Of course it&#39;s nice to specify if one takes a lot of inspiration from someone else, but it&#39;s not mandatory, because it&#39;s a new creation.

The datasets should <b>all</b> be publicly available, the artists should be able to find their artworks in these sets, and they should be able to opt-in/out. There needs to be more responsibility on the part not only of the companies providing the AI art producers, but the people who put together these datasets. Right now, it&#39;s all &quot;I don&#39;t know, I just used it, I just found the image and included it&quot; etc. But that&#39;s really not good enough for something that will cause such a profound change in society, in people&#39;s individual lives and livelihoods, in the accessibility/valuation of art. These people and companies need to get themselves in gear - they are mostly individuals or groups of computer nerds, not ready to deal with these kinds of changes that they have brought about. I respect that, and I also respect that it will take a lot of time and money to implement my idea. But I think that&#39;s more important. AI is supposed to be efficient, but it should ultimately be a *choice*. I should be able to choose whether I go to a human artist or computer. I should be able to choose whether I want my art/photo/likeness included in a dataset. I should not be told that it&#39;s too much time and money and, therefore, that that choice is a waste of time and money. These are things that should&#39;ve been thought about long before this point, ideally. But they weren&#39;t. So we need to do it now, while it&#39;s happening.

The medium is the message and all that jazz... <br><br>The near future is VR, computer games and cinema merge, VR and social media spaces will merge. AI will create new forms of art where the actual &#39;art&#39; I.e. Technical skill, thought and process lies in other areas.<br><br> Concepts like Tilt Brush by Google show a possible future for painting and sculpture, where once the detail and resultion, as well as haptic feedback are realistic enough you could imagine it as a totally valid evolution of painting. Painting in 3dimensions, painting environments, even collaboration in real time around the globe in a shared virtual space. Text to video promises the possibilities of movies only Jodorowsky could have dreamed of, and access to the common man/woman, much as the digital camera opened up photography to your average person in a far more profound way than Polaroids or getting your photos developed at the store. With access that makes these art forms more available to others, comes the loss of privilege. In some areas it will eventually make real hand created paintings more expensive, but less people will buy them in general.<br><br> It is one of those situations where you have to learn to transfer your skills and evolve, or find a way your artwork still stands out as unique. Personally I believe that the vast majority of artwork these days is simply merchandise, painted with the intention to sell right from it&#39;s inception, these AI images are just making this more obvious. Real art is process, the finished artwork is an artifact. So then you have to ask, what is the process of AI art, well there&#39;s the coding and development (you&#39;ll say that&#39;s technical not art, however the way you use and develop your tools for any physical artwork is still considered art if also technical) and then there&#39;s how you decide to use it, jerry rig it, how well you&#39;re able to make it bend to your imagination and what you do in order to make that happen, how you use it in ways no one has thought of. <br><br>I think reproducing other forms of art is a pretty boring thing for this new technology, trying to use it to create new forms of art will be what really stands out in the next ten years.<br><br>Overall we&#39;re all gonna die, even Shakespeare is dead, and one day he&#39;ll be forgotten and all his works.

This may be true, but Tesla actually counts any crash within 5 seconds after autopilot disengagement as a crash while on autopilot in their statistics. This is in the fine print on their stats in their reports and I think mentioned during a CVPR conference talk. I would have instead mentioned also more about how Waymo, Cruise, etc actually have human drivers that perform the high level planning for their autonomous cars, so they are really not as autonomous as you would expect. When they see eg. a delivery truck blocking the road, the car calls for help from the human and then the human creates a route around the truck. I have a friend who works on the software for this system at one of the major autonomous companies I mentioned.",1

I think you’re right that trained artists are going to be necessary for proper, good game art. In the same way, though, that we’re okay with artists painting digitally rather than physically, that training and know-how shines through proper use of their tools. It’s really a balance thing.

It&#39;s basically a quality of life time-saving tool that saves you from a bit of Googling now and then. Basically a smart snippet generator. What&#39;s problematic is that it&#39;s only really competent at creating small functions. What that might do is force you to use functional programming with many small functions that carry out simple tasks. What it seems great for is for helping save time starting up with a new framework that you&#39;re unfamiliar with, which is great because there are so many new frameworks cropping up left right and centre. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good enough to worry about, and I doubt teachers will have any problem testing students with access to this VS Code plugin, if it gets so good that it becomes a problem, students should just be tested in a controlled environment like an exam, or be asked to explain what the code does and why they chose to build it in such a way.

relevant,"I come from the beat production and sound design world where sampling “original” works or the world outside via field recordings, within respective terms, are utilized to create new sounds and music. I see the same thing happening with ai art. There are 2 things I am taking away from my experience. <br><br>By nature, I am a creative type. I enjoy creating new things by taking from the old. I guess you could say that I enjoy making old things new again by modifying what came before. With ai art I attempt to utilize multiple applications and photoshopping/photobashing techniques to further dilute the art styles that are contained within the checkpoint models. I enjoy experimenting with different models by mixing them together to create new styles, which is a similar approach to sample music production. Taking what already exists and creating something completely new is always the goal in this type of workflow. My interest isn’t in replication (creating something that already exists). I look for ways to push diffusions into territories the ai was not trained on. I like to break the “grid” so to say. Again, this is an approach that is very similar to beat production techniques. However, I do have the full understanding in how the ai was trained on copy protected work. Even custom checkpoint models today are trained on specific art styles from well known artists. Dead or alive. Because of this, I cannot accept full credit for the initial work that was utilized to cook a model. Credit might come from the practice in how one manages to manipulate a sample of an original piece, in such a way that the original intend and styling becomes unrecognizable. That is how I like approach my creative endeavors. This practice can be found in many forms of considerable art. Some are more masterful in their approach and thus are more recognized for it as well. However, with that being said, the art community should at the very least have control over checkpoint models or their own models they can create, which then in turn could be sold for profit. I’m also thinking in terms of licensing there could be deals made with artists who would allow certain pieces of art to be utilized commercially via a licensing fee. Otherwise, we should only have the ability to train the ai with our own artwork and style. Established artists should continue to maintain copyright of their own works, similar to to the practices we have in the music industry. Lastly, because of the recent ai art boom, I have developed an interest in pursuing digital painting/illustration because I would love to create my own art. I would love to train the ai on my own art style. My workflow would consist of illustrating a piece in photoshop and then running it through the ai engine to add or change details. Again, while I do truthfully enjoy ai art as much as I enjoy original works, I wouldn’t dare to disrespect an artistic professional. The time dedicated to developing masterpieces is invaluable. Everyone should respect that.",1

relevant,"I think the key point is not that we should be alarmed at an a.i.&#39;s ability to produce code, but that it could produce code we didn&#39;t ASK it to produce.  Maybe self-produced code is the result of an interpretation.  The a.i. developer instructs the a.i. to make reducing the time it takes to complete a task a goal.  Do your task as fast as you can.  Create code to shave off a few nanoseconds.  Then, the a.i. dev says to combine the functionality of contemporary computer languages.  With enough time and proper analysis of the a.i.&#39;s activity, maybe a new language will be generated.  Parts would be recognizable, but it would be a mish-mash.  Then, the dev asks the a.i. to generate code for front end software, u.i., sound effects, a pleasing color palette.  Prompt it.  Encourage it.  Eventually, I think, a.i. would satisfy an ever-increasing number of demands.  I believe the biggest obstacle for truly impressive a.i. (as we are already losing interest in its ability to churn out essays and qualify its medical advice with &quot;check with your physician, but....&quot;) will be merging the specialized a.i. into one.  Perhaps Dalle 2 and Chat GPT, an a.i. used to extrapolate effective proteins, and another to predict the spread of forest fires are incompatible.  But a.i. learning code will see things we may not.   Humans have often noted that a genius sees the connections between seemingly unrelated things.  And a universal a.i. will operate at a superhuman level, maybe they will provide insight into making more things into a single thing.  Coding will gallop right along with counting cattle from a drone, organizing voting districts, measuring happiness by facial recognition, inserting higher quality information into news broadcasts, or gaining an edge in the stock market.

All the cars will be connected to a network where the cars can communicate with each other. In that way, it can be created an instantaneous response to minimize harm in all humans around, for example with the car on the left manoeuvring as well, to create a controlled accident with less trauma. The remaining cars will have to stop or manoeuvre as well, all at the same time.<br><br>2) In the case that not all the system is connected to the network, the person to be affected is the same owner of the car, even if his life is at risk, because the casualty came on his way and that doesn&#39;t mean that he should put the life of others at risk too (it&#39;s logic). However, there could be better cars with a most equipped technology, that in the case an accident is going to happen, the computer can detect immediately and, unlike humans, it can deploy a responsive mechanism to try to protect the human, no matter what happens with the machine, like ejecting him before the accident happens, or transforming the car into a giant airbag, or even if the impact still occurs, the human can be covered by some sort of protected space inside the car, before the accident happens.<br><br>All these things are just a matter of research and try to find the best solution, instead of just being scared of self-driving cars and keep avoiding them for &quot;ethical reasons&quot;.",1

relevant,"I agree that most junior level programming will disappear in the next 5-10 years, specially in business specific applications (aka &quot;VBA crimes&quot;). However, as you can learn from the adoption rate of no-code/low-code, the industry is very slow to change and adopt. The main point is: it is very uncertain if AI can anytime soon can create higher level functions. What you can see today is replicating some &quot;hello world&quot; stuff, very unspecific, generic copy&amp;paste from the net. It is amazing and will change how code is written - however, i am uncertain it can replace a senior developer who works on a production system with sometimes hundreds of complicated business rules on a single function. As IA does not understand anything, i am afraid it might get stuck at the 70% line - it can produce something that is almost good enough, but getting the next 10-15% to make it useable for production might take an insane amount of effort. I am also unsure if AI generated code will every be good enough for critical functionality, as LLMs just replicate what they have as in input. <br><br>We use LLMs <b>a lot</b> every day, and we have a term for the typical LLM results: &quot;word vomit&quot;. As you get more experiences with generated content, you can spot &quot;word vomit&quot; or &quot;pixel vomit&quot; very quickly: AI generated images are off in many ways and so is much of the code it generates today. <br><br>To be clear: it will become much better and an below average developer will be in deep trouble - as the job will become much harder for a developer in the future. I also assume that developers will get paid MORE and will be in much higher demand. Why? When i created my first applications in 1995 most developers where fullstack - and the stack was very thin. I remember when PHP was introduced and the Java Server Pages guys made fun of it. Java Server Pages died out soon after, and the PHP ecosystem exploded. Then no-code showed up 20 years later and people predicted the death of all programming languages. Look inside a typical company, you might still find JSP applications and even worse: some niche programming language that was all the rage 20 years ago and is long forgotten - but still used by this one business app, that is kind of critical - not critical enough to be rewritten in an current language, of course. <br><br>My prediction is therefore: <br><br>#1 some teams will go full AI and will experience crazy productivity gains - and most of the developers will continue doing what they do today for the next 10-15 years. <br><br>#2 Yes, some copilot based technology will be used and we will see a big increase in productivity. Some companies already scale down teams by 2-3 developers (from 8-11) - and this seems to be highly effective for multiple reasons. <br><br>#3 It will take a VERY long time until LLMs will be adopted for on-premise production solutions. I would not be surprised if this is 10+ years<br><br>#4 we might soon enter a &quot;AI cold winter&quot; due to legal issues - blocking any investments for years to come. Expect companies to ban google copilot and similar tools due to legal concerns<br><br>#5 i am uncertain if there is a big first mover advantage in the application of AI at this point - companies seemed to rather wait for somebody else to take the risk and then move in quickly as soon as regulations and technology has become production ready.<br><br>#6 There are still a significant number of development teams who have not adopted even the basic practices: some teams even work without version control, no standard build pipelines or any testing. You can find projects that got started in 2023 with ZERO automated testing, no QM in the team, no coding guidelines etc. - in companies with 1K developers.<br><br>#7 decision makers do not like to take risks. Generative AI is currently the biggest liability and risk for a company. Yes, it is an amazing opportunity for a startup and a few early adopters - but most people have way to much to loose and nothing to gain from investing into it. So why should it take off quickly?<br><br>Just because we know how to build professional software does not mean that people actually do it.<br>Just because we have the power of generative AI for development does not mean that it will be adopted anytime soon - even IF it works &quot;good enough&quot;.",-1

What using other people&#39;s art does not mean, is when you go to a museum, an Instagram page, or wherever you consume other people&#39;s art, then go home and make your own art which is inspired by all the art you&#39;ve seen before. That&#39;s something no artist would have a problem with and that&#39;s how all artists in the history of art did it except for the first artists ever.<br>What happens with AI is much more like the latter one, not like the former one. The training data is NOT part of the model. It&#39;s only used to create the model. But not the training data but the model is what&#39;s being used to create AI art. Just like other people&#39;s art is used to create a new artist&#39;s skills by learning from it. Because AI learns, AI doesn&#39;t just copy.<br>Just ask yourself the following question: Would you tell new artists that they are not allowed to get inspired by or learn from your art or do you think other artists should be able to do that?<br><br>The best example for the difference between copying and learning is when I gave Dall•E the prompt to give me a man with a mohawk in a leather jacket on a Harley Davidson in the style of Vincent van Gogh. And that was exactly what I got. There aren&#39;t any originals from van Gogh where the AI could have copied the individual elements from. The AI actually had to learn how to do this.<br><br>I also heard about cases where people were able to reproduce virtually exact copies of original artworks with AI. However, in the studie I heard about (for transparency, I think it was done or financed by Google) they only managed to do this A in really rare cases and B only with the knowledge of the training data and C by purposely pushing the AI to produce a copy. That is NOT a realistic scenario.<br>Leaving that studie aside, it is just plausible, that the creators and users of AI are not even interested in that happening. They actually want to create something new, so they will actively try to avoid something which is already unlikely to happen in the first place.<br><br>However, there&#39;s one thing where the problem already CAN (doesn&#39;t have to) start with the training of the AI. Artworks of a certain artist can be part of training data, but training a model with the sole purpose of copying the artists style, is something only the artists themselves should be allowed to do. At least as long as the results get published. But when artists do that, AI could change from being a threat to being an artistic tool.<br>I think it&#39;s already a little bit lazy, not necessarily problematic, when you copy a certain artist&#39;s style by hand. But that at least is good for practicing. With AI, that doesn&#39;t give you the same benefit at all.<br><br>I also think there should be transparency about AI art. Just as with so much else, there&#39;s a competition in art. Even when it&#39;s not about money but &quot;just&quot; about the limited attention of your Instagram followers. Recognition is a totally legit currency for artists. You might win their attention by them having respect for you because you actually created this artwork. But they probably wouldn&#39;t give you the same respect when they know that you used AI to make it. So not being transparent about it, brings a bias into that comoetition.<br>However, you should also not overshoot it with your honesty and also loose the respect you might actually deserve. Because AI art does not equal AI art. You can type a prompt into a web based AI, generate 50 versions and then just take the best one, without having more influence than the prompt and the selection. Or you can use a local install of Stable Diffusion, where you can use several plug-ins like ControlNet which give you back some of the creative control, you load some of your own sketches which the result will be based on, perhaps you also create a completely original artwork which will be used as a style reference, you also don&#39;t just select the final result out of 50 versions but refine the result over and over again by slightly changing the prompt and doing some inpainting with new prompts and perhaps also new sketches for ControlNet, ...<br>Those are two completely different things which deserve a different level of respect. So yes, be transparent and mark your AI art as AI art, but in your own interest, just like at school in math, show your work. That way, you don&#39;t create any unfair bias to other &quot;manual&quot; artists, but you also regain the respect you actually deserve.",-1

That’s similar to where the issue is with AI for artists right now, there are people who are profiting off these models that use data originally meant for research purposes only and gathered by scraping the internet without anyone’s consent. Some of these AI generators have generated images with artist signatures visible. AI models currently aren’t able to generate a style if it isn’t fed that style. A human could potentially come up with a similar style to another artist having never seen their work. That misuse of data could set a bad precedent on what other companies can do with any data. (Which we already know won’t be good) This could overflow into more than just generating profile pictures, which is where AI is *currently*. AI is getting smarter and will be able to do more.

But would also make dedicated programmers a lot more productive: the only requirements would be to know the concepts and theory. No specific syntax no programming languages.

The AI learns itself when it is being fed the entire internet of text and images during the training process. What I&#39;m trying to say is, the reason it is having this problem is because whoever is feeding the model the data is feeding it &quot;Politically correct&quot; and biased data or punishing it when it makes a politically incorrect statement or image (left wants diversity in their images of groups of people, so &quot;whitewashed images&quot; are not what google would go for). Also, it&#39;s likely that the foundation model isn&#39;t biased, it&#39;s the REFINED models using RLHF (Reinforcement Learning by Human Feedback) that creates biases afterwards. There&#39;s a possibility that the raw foundation model of Google&#39;s Gemini is extremely unbiased. <br><br>But yeah, key point is that the people who write the code only right the rules, they don&#39;t program in the bias. A great analogy would be writing the rules of evolution and letting the complexity of nature emerge over millions of years, which is exactly like the programmers writing the rules of how the AI learns and letting it learn by itself (Humans then go in and corrupt it with bias after the initial training process).",-1

relevant,"I think there will always be a market for human made art especially since AI lacks any sort of vision or intent behind it. You already see it in people&#39;s reactions to anything AI. AI at best imitates what humans do but for humans who wish to spend money on some music they&#39;d rather settle for the real thing every time.<br><br>That being said, you are right about companies and big clients being unwilling to spend thousands in order to hire a composer to make music for them when they can just get an AI to do it. Unfortunately I think that that just represents the problem with our modern day creative economy: on top of consumers and producers, we have middlemen who have no respect for art or particular love for artists in most cases, but are the ones who are essentially financially supporting their careers. To them, artists are nothing more than employees who produce products for them to sell, and when they can cut costs by hiring a robot to do it, they&#39;ll likely settle for that.<br><br>As much as people say that this will lead to greater creativity, my worry is that it will likely lead to a bunch of layoffs in the professional space, and since corporations don&#39;t care at all about being creative, the music they settle on will end up becoming generic to the displeasure of the average consumer (who like I said finds AI soulless compared to human made art). Just look at how the video game industry works with big game companies jumping at live service games and monetization schemes. The one good thing that I see is that we may see music careers shift to the independent space instead of relying on corporations to hire them. A company may not want to spend thousands on hiring a particular artist they don&#39;t really care about, but I can see regular people giving small dollars to support a particular musician they personally like continuing to make music the way they can. <br><br>Of course that assumes that we as a society decide that all art should just be automated and somehow see no value in human made art at all. I mean, art as an industry always depends on us supporting it, but yeah we would be entering a dystopian future in that case. Let&#39;s just all hope that that doesn&#39;t come to pass.",-1

This will overall effect the quality of work that will be produced in the future in all artistic medium. You can blame this on the plagiarists who used this technology for personal profit at the expense of hard working artists, most which had to work for over decades to master their craft. <br><br>AI art still requires understanding of composition, creativity, and deeper concepts, and thus the best operators of this technology would actually be other seasoned artists.

This happens to a lot of people honestly.<br>Instead your original studies are from nature and reality. You need a grasp on weight, anatomy, harmonious design, color, proportion and angle to develop yourself as an artist all of these can be gained without study of other artists except for MAYBE the concept of harmonious design and like that’s more of glancing at styles as a concept. And you may be thinking oh that’ll only make you make realistic art.

relevant,"Simple concept since I can tell you we are a little ways away from putting a system on a car that can determine head gear. My thought brings it back to a more simplistic approach based on instinctual nature, just now programmed. I&#39;m going to give my thoughts in a stepped up version starting with basic and simple up to higher complexities. My view is that of someone going into electrical engineering, as well as a fireman on a department that services two of the most heavily used, midwest interstates. I have also added at the end of each order paragraph a summary of what devices and/or systems will be needed to include that order in a vehicle. <br><br>First order: All else fails, vier right, slow down. In countries where you drive on the wrong side of the road, vier left. This is simple as it would cause you to push you or the others into the shoulder away from oncoming traffic. This minimizes the chances that someone will be pushed into an oncoming lane and, assuming everyone is paying attention, will allow the person on that side to divert to the shoulder. This requires no input device other than danger detection. <br><br>Second order: Vier toward noted/mapped shoulder including grass areas w/o steep drop. No shoulder, Stop. This will be used in places where there may be a closer shoulder on the opposite side or in the case of construction where the shoulder was moved or on a bridge with no shoulder. This can be maintained by adding a single bit of information to all routed roads accessible to the car and updated based on reads by it or other cars. The basic system requires only a stored map of safe shoulders. <br><br>Third order: If all local lanes are moving in the same direction, and there is a large gap, vier towards it, including the inside shoulder of a highway. This is the first step in complexities relying on simple wide angle cameras or any form of distance and object detection already used. In this case, the motorcyclist/scooterist could potentially take the penalty; however, they also have the smallest footprint in a lane and the highest capability of accelerating out of the way. This method will only be used if their presence is not detected, either based on them being a distance from the sensor or any other occurrences that throw off the detection. This requires only local awareness technology already in use. <br><br>Fourth order: Large gaps detected nearby by others, vier in direction. This begins a much more complex area whereby the cars start communicating with each other. This networking is already being put in place by modern self driving cars or assisted driving cars. This order relies on the other vehicles informing your car of potential avoidances and where it can vier with the same idea as moving toward the right for the shoulder, only this time its a moving shoulder/gap. This requires sensor&#39; information to be broadcastable locally, possibly over a decided wifi channel. <br> <br>Fifth order: Communicate to other smart cars to make a necessary gap to allow yours to divert. This is merely an increase from the previous order adding the complexity of all the local cars determining the optimal direction of movement. This requires the computers to link and process all information quickly and accurately, then send out instructions. <br><br>Sixth order: No detectable oncoming traffic, move to oncoming lane, then back immediately. This is put farther down the complexity tree as it would require a good bit more in communicating systems before relying on a car to determine an oncoming lane to be the correct choice right away. Even if it is observably empty. This requires sensors either on the road or for every vehicle to be required to broadcast position reliably to a system immediately accessible to the vehicle. <br><br>Through these six orders you might note that I haven&#39;t actually addressed the given matter directly. This is because that would rely on deliberately deciding to hurt someone. I indirectly stated my decision in the second order though by saying that if the car can determine no shoulder, it is to simply stop. This decision is due to my experience from recorded crashes and participating at accident scenes as a fireman. If there is a shoulder and people can move to it, damage and harm will be minimized by diverting in that direction. However, if there is a barricade on both sides, such as is often the case with a bridge, then diverting will cause more damage and all involved passengers will end up hurt. If there is a guarantee that everyone will be hurt extensively, then minimizing the number hurt becomes priority to improve the ability to save those hurt.",1

relevant,"Graphic artist turned copyright lawyer/professor weighing in here. I’ve spent the better part of past two decades teaching copyright and contract law at law schools, art schools, ComicCon’s, etc. A huge part of the problem is the art school model here in the US. Rare is the art school that puts serious effort behind teaching its students copyright and contract issues that are at the heart of every artist’s career. <br>Quite literally every time I teach at a new school or guest lecture for an art teacher I spend the majority of the time undoing the misinformation passed on to the students by professors who think that creativity is the only thing that matters in an artist’s career. <br>But here’s the funny thing: it’s not the art students to feel that way. I’m a product of art school myself and can tell you that the students who have taught for the past 10 years have been increasingly hungry for information on how to turn their art into a sustainable career. But if the school administration is not prioritizing the protection of art or the licensing of an artist&#39;s work product, they are failing their graduates.<br>You may be wondering why this is at all relevant to the issue of AI?<br>Simple: copyright law is complex and often counterintuitive. However, virtually everybody in the tech space knew this was coming for years now. Ask yourself — how many of you in art school learned about the encroaching copyright issues of AI-generated art? What would’ve happened if the art community had been informed before everything hits the fan this year was AI art? As both a practicing attorney and an academic I think it likely that you would have well-researched position papers and nonprofit arts groups seeking to bring cases to court to challenge the AI encroachment BEFORE this “AI-Artmageddon.”",1

It always has been a natural aspect of a developing society that certain jobs will get redundant and eventually die out. This can be negative and positive, of course. A lot of tradition and culture gets lost, but a lot of unfortunate work environments will also die out (e.g. making mochi by hand is dying out in Japan, but also painting watches with radium paint isn’t a thing anymore). <br><br>However, I see a problem with the training required for the new jobs. Not everybody who is artistic can become a programmer, but a programmer can become an artist with ease through these AI programs. Furthermore, one programmer can make art for, let’s say, 50 artists with one program. Sure, the jobs would “simply shift” from artists to programmers. But not everybody can afford the training required to become a programmer, or has the understanding to become one. There’s a problem already with jobs requiring degrees despite not really needing one. Being an artist is one of those jobs that don’t require degrees, but if this job now shifts to programmers, it will be. <br><br>I’m on the fence with AI art.

The people who run these AI image generators are making a profit on them, they charge fees for generating images with these bots they &quot;made&quot;. By myself, and everyone else who&#39;s art is being used in them get nothing. If they had gotten permission, and the artists were getting a percentage or some sort of royalties, or anything really, i&#39;d be totally fine with it! <br><br>(I&#39;m self employed, if i don&#39;t sell my art, i don&#39;t make any income. I can&#39;t have a normal job due to health issues, same with many artists i know who have also had their work taken and used in the datasets)<br><br>The other thing i want to say is that without the images they are using without consent, without the millions of hours of hard work us artists have put into our craft, their AI image generators would be nothing. They wouldn&#39;t work. Their entire setup relies on the things we&#39;ve made, and its insulting and disrespectful to just scrape all of that hard work into a little bot that can just spit out images faster than us artists could ever hope to. The more it improves and the better it gets, the more its going to put actual artists at risk. <br><br><br>I don&#39;t do fanart, but i feel like thats not comparable to what is being done here. Fanart is most often made by individual artists, but the owners of said characters (like pokemon, or anime, or videogames) are usually large corporations that aren&#39;t going to notice a dip in profits at all whatsoever if some kid at anime expo is selling pikachu keychains that they made at home. If people start using an AI to generate images in my style, I am going to notice that financially. If the value of art falls because of these image generators, big corporations will most likely profit off of it (because they can pay less to artists for their art), and actual artists will suffer. Also, if a big corporation really had a problem with fanart (which sometimes they do!) they have the full ability to go after artists and send them cease and desist letters. Comparing self employed individual artists to corporations in the context of fanart is not a fair comparison.<br><br>I get what people are saying when they compare the AI programs to people getting inspiration from art around them. Its inevitable to be inspired and influenced by the art you see and learn from as an artist, but, these AI image generators aren&#39;t real people. Its a program that an individual or team worked on and made. That team had full power over getting consent from artists for use of their images, and they didn&#39;t. Thats a conscious decision. Also, people getting inspired are able to understand nuance and what is and isn&#39;t appropriate when being inspired. AI cannot make this distinction, what is generates has no basis on what would or wouldn&#39;t be considered ok in art communities. <br><br>(this isn&#39;t related to anything you&#39;ve said in the video but people are already posting AI images under the guise of them being the artists who &quot;painted&quot; them, as well as using this to scam people into &quot;commissioning them&quot; for images they use and AI to generate. Also pretty much everywhere images are posted or shared are being flooded with AI stuff. Not sure where this fits into any of the arguments but I wanted to mention it.)<br><br>To be clear, i don&#39;t dislike AI, I honestly think its great and it can be such a powerful tool for artists of any type to be inspired and build off of, but with how its being done now, it takes agency away from the artists its building off of. If the people making the datasets had gotten consent, and the artists being profited off of were getting at lease some sort of kick back, I&#39;d be 100% fine with it. (and at least as far as i know, many other artists would be ok with this as well if this is how it was being done) <br><br>(sorry for the long comment, i&#39;m planning my own video about AI and have,,, a lot of feelings about it)",-1

These entities, controlled by a wealthy elite, prioritize financial gains over the welfare of their employees. Historically, advancements in automation, fueled by human creativity, have often led to reduced workforce requirements, enabling companies to increase profitability. This trend has contributed to the concentration of wealth among a small percentage of individuals at the top, who benefit at the expense of the broader workforce. The deployment of AI in various sectors is a continuation of this pattern. It&#39;s crucial to recognize that the root cause of job displacement is not the technology, but the unchecked capitalist system and the greed that drives it. Addressing the power and influence of this oligarchy is a critical challenge facing humanity, rather than attributing the issue to the technology itself. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23endtheoligarchy"">#EndTheOligarchy</a>",1

Enabling people to realize whats in their head sounds like a huge selling point. But AI does not create any knowledge, but dependence. Someone who does not have the abilities to write a song will still not be able to write a song but be dependent on AI tools to create something. <br>Education and training are the tools which really enable and make people independent to express their own unique creativity. The struggle to make an idea into something others can enjoy is part of the creative process, because it forces you to think differently, to find solutions. Each work of art is the result of the whole unique human experience of the artist, a series of thousands of individual experiences and creative choices. Generating AI skips all of that. AI may create you a song, but not the song, YOU would have created. And thats a huge difference.<br>And for the copyright part: the human inspiration and the AI &quot;inspiration&quot; is not the same. If you paint something in the style of van Gogh the outcome will still be highly influenced by your personal experience of the art. Maybe you will focus more on the paintstrokes, or the colours, or the light. Maybe you connect van Gogh to a certain emotion or memory. In the end you will make a lot of individual creative decisions which will lead to your own unique work of art. AI does not does not have any that.<br>The worst outcome could be that in the future the creative monopol may lie in the hands of AI coorporations. In the capitalist world we live the human factor is the worst for business. Artists can have a creative crisis, may get sick, may sometimes be not easy to deal with. Now there is a solution which steadily creates vast amounts of output without any of these problems and of course this has the potential to push aside human creators on the long term. And creators may become dependent on their tools to realize their artistic ideas.<br>There of course will still be musicians, artists, writers who will be stars and create unique masterpieces, but for vast majority of small, independent and unique thinking artists this will make a situation much harder, which is already much less than favourable.",-1

But coming up with style or idea, may take a lot of time, effort, and brilliance. When Apple got their autonomous car tech stolen by a Chinese employee, they flipped out and it was on the news. The music industry and its fans flip out when one singer copies another singer, or when there is slight similarity in the songs. But when artists call out that their style or idea is being copied by others, they are called cry babies.

relevant,"Something that I&#39;ve had discussion with people I know who went to art school: human artists definitely do learn from other artists. Traditional painting students go to museums and galleries with canvas and easel to copy well known woks. Some of this is to teach them to observe these paintings to work out the techniques the original artists used (brush strokes, color choices, layout, subject matter, etc), but it was/is also a way to help the student familiarize themself with what worked. This was especially useful before the ability to mass produce images in color, but even now, there&#39;s a world of difference between seeing a poster of the Mona Lisa and see it in person.<br><br>Arguably, AIs analyzing a large corpus of work to &quot;understand&quot; a particular artistic field may not be any different from sending a human to conservatory or art school for 5 years to learn the techniques and theories of their field. Not arguable is the fact that all creators first start by copying. You copy your teacher when you start learning an instrument. (Was married to a music teacher. Know this from direct experience.) You copy existing works in graphic arts, if only as little as samples in the text books.<br><br>The difference with an AI doing the same thing is that 1) we don&#39;t understand how the AI does it, and 2) we&#39;re scared of machines. Unarguably, we don&#39;t understand how artists create new work.

I&#39;ve seen firsthand the readings the robots get from lidar, short range radar, long range radar, normal cameras, and depth sensing cameras (Intel Realsense). The bots originally had ultrasonic sensors but they were removed in favor of radar which is a lot better and can deal with inclement weather much better than cameras or lidar, though Tesla also ditched radar for no good reason from their cars. The lidar systems we used were probably $10000 each by themselves for a really good 360 spinning lidar system with a very long range (I think it was like 30 meters). The short range radar could cover a nearly 180 degree sweep and tell where an object was and how far it was up to about 9 meters and would make a 2d point loud within that vision cone. It would 3asily spot something the size of a child and those sensors were not that expensive either, though implementing them is a bit complicated as the surface they looking through can cause reflections and putting them near metal causes problems and a host of other issues.<br><br>Long story short the delivery robot project still was years away from being safe to move robots at 15mph around pedestrians on the sidewalk at night or during the rain, let alone a car on the road at several times that speed with shittier or no sensors besides cameras.

I&#39;ve spent my time creating &quot;art,&quot; as in, what you all would expect, a piece of me that I created that was inspired and expressed. I&#39;ve also spent my time creating &quot;designs,&quot; that is, purely graphical things, usually through software, that people and organizations need. I don&#39;t see the latter as &quot;art,&quot; but I get frustrated when &quot;AI Art&quot;  is being touted as &quot;art&quot; when it&#39;s just &quot;graphics,&quot; or as you described -- process. Neither is better than the other, this is just arguing semantics. What I don&#39;t like is all the fear mongering and finger pointing that&#39;s happening, especially coming from artists. I get embarrassed with how woefully uninformed they are about technology and are just saying it needs to be banned flat-out. That&#39;s not going to happen, technology will keep progressing. We need to determine how we perceive this. In the perfect world, as you described, we could train AI to our own works and produce things we simply don&#39;t have time for, just like outsourcing in-betweens from a Korean animation studio. If money was never exchanged, this would be fantastic. AI being used as a tool. But the issue is money is involved, artists are being displaced, and those that own the software charge per image. If this was really a tool, as it should be, then there would be no charge. No one charges me each time I hammer in a nail. Unfortunately, we don&#39;t live in that perfect world.<br><br>That said, plagiarism and stealing have ALWAYS been a problem in the art world -- we&#39;re just now seeing the tech bros give people license to do it through another degree of separation.

If NFTs, the metaverse, and crypto are anything to learn from, I would say that these grifters will be done in about a year and move onto the next big tech &quot;disrupter.&quot; The general public will have a keener eye on how to detect AI art and will just brush it off as trivial digital bloat. Websites like DeviantArt, Pixiv, and other communities will establish guidelines and expectations when it comes to AI generated anything. Once all these scenarios eventually happen, artists will have a chance to take ownership of this tool and use it as it was intended.<br><br>You can both hate the grifters and thieves while still advocating for the advancement of advanced computer generated graphics.",1

Ai for now understands what you&#39;re trying to do and is not trying to anything. At its core that is what it is trying to do and that&#39;s to recognise patterns and make predictions. We&#39;re still in the lead were just getting a wake up call. <br><br>Resisting the temptation to ask AI for what you know it already knows and can help you become productive is only blinding. We have to embrace this type of technology and shift our identities to something more healthier and that is to create through problem solving insteading of trying to solve problems solved. <br><br>Its time for us to learn business skills.

I&#39;m really glad you juxtaposed Cobain &amp; Lennon with Drake &amp; Kanye, because the one thing you know about Cobain&#39;s original records is that the kind of vocal processing that is slathered all over the Drake &amp; Kanye tracks are things that Lennon didn&#39;t have, and Cobain would have bristled at using, even though some of it was available before Cher broke the Autotune secret. What I find is that AI is really good at spoofing voices that are already heavily processed, and much less convincing when it comes to &quot;natural&quot; singers who have virtually nothing done to them in production but a little bit of reverb and EQ.<br><br>I watched your tribute video to Gordon Lightfoot last night, and what struck me is just what an incredible vocal sound he produced naturally with virtually no processing. It&#39;ll be a long time, I think, before there&#39;s an AI that can duplicate what he could do vocally. Could an AI do a convincing copy of Cher&#39;s &quot;Believe&quot; from 1998? I think it could. But could it do a convincing copy of Cher&#39;s cover of Linda Ronstadt&#39;s &quot;When Will I Be Loved&quot; (originally written by Phil Everly) the way she belted it out in 1975? There I don&#39;t think so. And it&#39;s not because of the talent of the performer, but because of the way things have changed in production from one to the other.<br><br>Fast-forward to Kanye West, whose infamous live attempt to sing &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; is a pretty good example of what his natural singing voice sounds like. Could he sell a record without the effects that make him easy to copy with an AI? Even before the recent heel-turn of his career, I don&#39;t know. It feels like in some ways, the tastes and styles of vocal production in pop music over the last 20 years have been something of a devil&#39;s bargain: the electronic perfection of Katy Perry&#39;s &quot;California Gurls&quot; over the organic imperfections of Michael Jackson&#39;s &quot;Thriller&quot; has come at the cost of opening itself up to convincing AI duplication.<br><br>The measure of a vocalist over the next 10 years may not be a question of who &quot;sounds good,&quot; since you can get &quot;sounding good&quot; from a box now even more than before. It&#39;ll be a question of who &quot;sounds human&quot;—who can make you aware through their singing, however imperfect, that you&#39;re listening to a real human being sing about something, and feel some way about it while they&#39;re singing it.<br><br>It&#39;ll have the effect of making some singers more &quot;digitally replaceable&quot; than others.

However, this “laptop producer” world we live in today only has shorten our attention span for music. People, already, don’t connect with music the same way we did before, when the barrier of entrée to be an artist required more skill. To @telleryn point the sheer volume of synthetic music that already has taken countless jobs from studio musicians, and performing musicians, ie: artists perform with a laptop vs a band, is staggering and frankly unbearable for working musicians trying to make a living. When you add AI to a creative space and an industry that’s already edging out the “little man”, it just exacerbates the already existing problems. Musicians/instrumentalist  hardly ever get paid from royalties. There is an incredibly huge amount of musicians/instrumentalist behind each record that gets produce and they get a onetime fee for their work. In my opinion those folks are the real victims of AI, not the song’s interpreter. They should have been included in this video.

relevant,"Hadn&#39;t heard of that pseudo-write one before. Right when I think novels are safe...<br><br>And it&#39;s so frustrating, because as you point out, there are absolutely ways that AI can be used to enhance and promote creativity. I write, but my drawing skills are much more limited. I could give descriptions of my characters to an AI and have it generate images of them. Either to use as reference, or inspiration for different scenarios. I could have it generate a voice or something for them, make them argue with me, or each other. See what wacky things it comes up with. Explore the characters from a new perspective and thus deepen my understanding of them, which in turn informs my writing. The art itself doesn&#39;t even have to be the end goal - it&#39;s used purely for me, to play with and visualise ideas.<br><br>There&#39;s other areas where AI would be a natural fit, too. Vocal synths have been around for a while, and have begun to transition to AI now too. I&#39;ve seen demos of various Vocaloid characters done with AI engines, and some of them sound incredible. Vocaloid has always been marketed as a singer for musicians/composers who can&#39;t sing themselves, and entire communities and subcultures have formed around the characters used to market them, created almost entirely by the producers and listeners. They were tuned by a human hand, and while some producers became very good at it, it was hardly a painless and accessible process. AI is the next natural evolution of that, and indeed, if the technology had been available at the time it was first made, is probably how it would have been implemented to begin with. It&#39;s always been about how the producer uses the character, the music made around them, the story the song tells. Entire story worlds have been created around these characters, by communities. An AI voice in this case makes that even more accessible than ever... I think it&#39;s an interesting look at how artificial tools &quot;should&quot; be used, as a lot of the criticism it once attracted has parallels with arguments for and against AI (e.g. &quot;not real music&quot; bc no human singer, but still written and tuned by a human composer and inspiring many other humans to make derivative artworks by their own hand, etc)<br><br>The strength of AI is 100% in those crossover areas, filling the gaps in a creative&#39;s skillset to enjoy or enhance their work beyond what they could accomplish alone. Even the AI comic you mentioned seems like a natural area, being used to enhance the story that was written by a human (though I agree the images themselves shouldn&#39;t be copyrightable/sellable in their own right, at least not without the circumstances around AI art being less murky than they are now. It&#39;s tricky. I like the potential of it, but that specific circumstance feels a bit bleh).<br><br>But I 100% agree with you on the corporatisation of it all. And while I sincerely hope that we end up with a world where AI is used to augment creatives/empower individual expression, the cynical part of me doesn&#39;t think it can happen. I&#39;ve seen discussions amongst some entrepeneurs at conferences about the possibilities of AI in all creative fields, seen presentations about how to use it as a &quot;hack&quot; for your business. Every single entrepeneur present at that talk was <b>salivating</b> over it. They didn&#39;t care that it looked wonky, or that it looked low quality - they saw only fast and cheap. One of them even quipped about AI meaning they &quot;no longer have to pay a sound engineer $80 an hour to edit the &#39;ums&#39; out of their podcast.&quot; As the sound person making their mic work at the time (and being paid considerably less than 80 an hour to do so), it didn&#39;t really sit that well with me...<br><br>I hope you&#39;re right in that this is our chance to get ahead of it. I really do. Absolutely, humans will always make art, but I am dreading the flood of low effort crap that seems doomed to flood everything we see. The noise is hard enough to get through even without AI on the scene. My one hope is that corporatisation of AI will kind of kill itself before long - it&#39;ll flood the world with so much, their customers simply will not be able to process it anymore. It collapses under its own weight. I hope we can legislate in time to ensure that AI is used ethically, primarily as a tool for individuals or cross-field interactions with human works.

The way to make an A.I. program that would NOT copy and paste is to teach that program how to paint, draw, sketch, etc. The primitive AARON program was a great example of this, it didn&#39;t use a data base of existing art and try to replicate that, it simply analyzed the techniques of how to create art and implements those techniques to create. By using a database of existing art, your A.I. is not learning how to create, rather, it is learning how to replicate. These programs analyze lines, styles, patterns and then mashes them up into these &quot;original&quot; images. Some artists have already begun doing side by sides, pointing out where their original designs are replicated in the AI designs with little (or in some cases no) change.

relevant,"It&#39;s pretty basic: AI can never replace true art, it can only replace content. Art is generated by first having an individual that through a remix of ideas imagine a meaning, an intent, a message, an emotional will to connect etc. and second, a receiver, a person who interprets that art and forms their own meaning as a fusion between the artists intent and their own experience of it. An AI can definitely create art, but it will be that AIs art, as long as it has the intellectual capacity to form a meaning through their creation and not just remix alone. So even if we&#39;re flooded with content created by AIs, people will still flock to artists with a specific and interesting perspective, because that artist will alone be that output. Even if some AI perfectly emulates that artist, they would still not be able to predict where they&#39;re heading with their next art because it&#39;s a mix of their own previous creation and their present experience. <br><br>Art is therefor unable to be replaced, it can only be contributed by having an AI being its own individual artist. Content, however, a pure output of just &quot;stuff&quot; that&#39;s made for background noise without any real meaning or purpose other than to be what it is, will definitely be replaced. Think of stock photography, stock music, web design etc. can easily be replaced. Of course, someone who would want something more than just stock material and such content would need an artist to create that. I doubt that a director like Robert Eggers would want to use an AI to compose the music for his films, he would want a specific composer who he can work with creatively. For real artists, there are so much more stuff that goes along with creation than just a simple output based on remixed ideas. It needs an individual perspective to compose those new ideas. <br><br>What will happen though, is that artists can quantify their creations more easily. In 3D design, someone can make one chair and then iterate thousands of versions based on it, but the original design is still their own.",1

relevant,"Being an artist who&#39;s always had a fascination with new technology and AI, watching this go down was really interesting, and stressful.<br><br>The existential crisis I had was insane, one of the most horrifying feelings I&#39;d ever had.<br>I picked up a pencil for the first time at maybe age 2, I was called an artist by my mom when I was 3-4 years old. &quot;Artist&quot; was as core to my ego as my name, the second I was capable of doing anything, I was an artist, and my family was heavily supportive and really promoted my love for art.<br>I never went more than a month without drawing at least something for pretty much my whole life, even in my darkest moments, I told myself &quot;my purpose is to create&quot;, and then AI came along, and I was excited, cause I&#39;ve had my eye on this exact technology for years, I saw the artwork these things were making even before it hit the mainstream. I loved watching videos of people trying to train learning AI programs on their computers to do stuff for them, even if the results always ended up an uninterpretable mess, the early AI programs were really fun, especially text generators that would write things surprisingly intelligible, but also incredibly silly. I liked the accessibility of it, everyone being able to make art, a big hurtle for my creativity is the amount of time it took for something to go from an idea in my head, to an actual concept on paper. AI Dungeon was super fun to play around with, it helped me get ideas for writing when I get stuck, it was like having a writing partner without the hassle of having a friend you trust enough to see your cringe first draft, and I also liked the randomness and nonsensicalness, since the AI didn&#39;t understand continuity well, it would just say shit sometimes which would jostle me out of my comfort zone, even if what it said was really stupid, it&#39;d get my creative juices flowing.<br><br>One day, AI became really powerful, I had already seen some really impressive generated images before, but now it was mainstream, everyone knew about it, and it was also very rapidly getting better all of a sudden. Everyone was using AIs to generate more complex concepts like &quot;capybara gaming&quot;, the biggest thing was how the AI could take an object and put it in lighting conditions I knew damn well it had next to no reference images for, like a capybara under bisexual lighting. I saw an image of a capybara, wearing a gaming headset, it&#39;s hooves on a gaming keyboard, blue and pink lighting in a dark room, I never knew AI could create a realistic image that specific before.<br>I played around with these AIs too for a bit and had a lot of fun with it, I remember thinking &quot;I wonder if I could try to make my fursona in this thing&quot;, and that&#39;s when it hit me, the &quot;Oh cool&quot; quickly became &quot;Oh SHIT&quot;. <br>Up until that point, I had never made money on my art, but I always wanted to, it was my dream to make money off my passion, I know it&#39;s hard to make a living off art nowadays, I knew it wasn&#39;t going to be easy, but it was my ultimate goal and commissions were going to be my stepping stone to that. Within seconds, I realized human commissioners were obsolete, and this was only the beginning, the AI was getting better and better, I knew that all artistic markets would be swallowed up eventually, it was only a matter of time.<br><br>What&#39;s the point of me then I thought, a piece of art that would take me hours, days, or even weeks to complete, could be done for me by a machine in minutes. This talent that took me almost two decades to get good at and still have a lot to learn even, a machine has perfected. Long story&#39;s short, I had the worst depressive episode of my life, a chronic feeling of near crippling existential dread that lasted for an entire year. I did nothing the whole year, absolutely nothing, I lost all sense of self and sometimes couldn&#39;t even physically move because I couldn&#39;t fathom an explanation to why I should. The AI thing wasn&#39;t the only cause of the depression, the pandemic, housing crisis, other identity types of identity crisis&#39;s I was having, but the AI was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back, I had no &quot;my purpose is art&quot; to fall back on anymore, so I just fell directly into the void with nothing to pad my fall.<br><br>I&#39;ve healed the last couple months, there was a time I still forced myself to draw and paint, but once I got burnt out from that, I found purpose in other things, physical art mediums mostly, and valuing community and the people in my life. there&#39;s no shortage of content on the internet, but there absolutely is a shortage of relationships of all kinds. My ultimate goal is to help out the people I love and trust, sounds cheesy as hell but I&#39;m being dead serious, after nearly 10 years of living alone as a withdrawn, introverted shy person, knowing what it&#39;s like to be devoid of connection for unhealthy periods of time, people are very important to me.",1

But the art industry is grossly underfunded and underrespected. A majority of the art industry are independent artists. And they have been abused in so many ways. Getting their art stolen and sold on shirts without receiving a penny, getting scammed, getting told so many times &quot;oh, I&#39;ll just pay you in exposure&quot; as if their time and effort doesn&#39;t matter, being shit on from every direction, etc etc etc. It was already tough enough when artists had to compete with each other and the companies that stole their art for merch. But having to compete with robots that can perfectly replicate your work and having your work used to train that robot to perfectly your work? That&#39;s such a big slap in the face for these abused artists. Especially when these artists then get a lot of shit for not being okay with all of this. In a vacuum, artists would probably be much more interested in the technology. But unfortunately we don&#39;t live in a vacuum.

So neither of those are comparable cuz it’s not blatant plagiarism nor are they depriving humans of creative experiences.<br>Also, music becoming more “computer generated” is not the same or even comparable.

I also hate (and refuse to buy cars with them) the current &quot;safety features&quot; that make a car stop by itself or do any action without my input. I know what is best and I also drive how I want. I count on my car to perform as expected according to my input. If it suddenly decides to do something else because it thinks what I&#39;m doing is &quot;unsafe&quot; then shit will actually become unsafe. To give a small example...if I slide off the road in snow or ice in a &quot;safety smart&quot; car it would hit the brakes and shut down....where as the proper thing to do (what I do) is to keep on the gas so I cam have momentum to swerve back out of the ditch. Another example....I live in the city and driving on the interstate requires a certain aggressiveness. When I switch lanes I&#39;m often doing it with inches to spare...a &quot;safety feature&quot; car would swerve me back over when it &quot;detected I was too close to another car&quot; and then I would be hit by the vehicle that (previously behind me) is now entering the area of space I just moved from. There are a million more examples I could give. Some even life changing...for instance if I&#39;m running late to my job and doing 90 in a 55 one of those stupid &quot;smart safe&quot; cars would probably shut down my throttle...and then I&#39;d get fired. Or back to the interstate scenario....the speed limit ranges from 55-70mph depending on area but everyone is going 80 plus, if I was in one of those fucking &quot;safety cars&quot; it would cut my throttle so I couldn&#39;t go with the flow of traffic....thus making me a target.

During that period of time we will go from humans having dominant control over AGSIPs to AGSIPs being capable of having dominant control over humans.

relevant,"One aspect of musical AI that is already quite mature and that I am genuinely excited about is AI that handles the busywork of music production. DAW plugins like iZotope Ozone or Sonible smart:EQ will listen to your music and automatically set EQ curves, compressor and limiter settings, and other elements that are oftentimes more technical than artistic. They rarely get it perfect, but they genuinely save a lot of time getting into the ballpark, and novice producers can get away with setting and forgetting. And Logic has a proprietary drum machine, straightforwardly called Drummer, that uses AI to analyze the other tracks in your piece and create MIDI as though a live drummer were following along with the rest of the band. Like Anthony Jackson versus MIDI, this AI can&#39;t match what a skilled human drummer can do, but if the drums aren&#39;t the main focus of your piece, it absolutely can save you a ton of time and sound perfectly serviceable.<br><br>To me, these applications of musical AI don&#39;t replace human creativity, but rather augment it. There are parts of music-making where we&#39;re truly leaving our imprint with artistic vision, and there are parts of music-making that kind of need to be there for a piece to be finished but it&#39;s there to support the really interesting stuff. Like gigging off of a lead sheet, sometimes the melody is the main idea you want to communicate to another musician. If we leave the busywork to AI, we don&#39;t get lazier - instead, we have more time to focus on the more interesting stuff. And I think that&#39;s awesome!",1

I tend to fall in the No camp because an AI model can gather hundreds of human lifetimes worth of art training/experience in a matter of days… there’s just no competing with that. There is a significant time price for a human artist to pay in order to learn another artists style.
