You invest in the tech, you invest in a non-profit that gets you 5 billion images as a database then you use prompters as a feedback tool for the machine (free work and sometimes they pay to work basically). It&#39;s true that we as humans are to blame for unethical or bad use of the tech, but that does not excuse the tech bros that promote &quot;ai is democratizing art&quot; speech while destroying the market and art communities.

relevant,"As an artist I want to raise/expand a couple points that, kinda go a bit further outside of the scope of the video! <br><br>First, there&#39;s already a concern as to what ultimately these AI are being trained for.  AI being trained to recognize faces is already something that can be quite dubious.  As facial recognition and other forms of AI already see use in policing, it is rather concerning to see this touted as something to do just for fun, when we don&#39;t really what the corporation training the AI is gonna do with it even a couple years from now.  It&#39;s not exclusive to Lensa, yet I feel is a bit important to note, considering the tech industry can be really messed up.<br><br>Now, moving past the realm of the concerns that arises from facial recognition and Lensa.  I think the limits of language around &quot;art theft&quot; has distracted from more important things.  Not all databases are based on Stable Diffusion, there have been AIs that were specifically marketed as being trained to match specific artists, even down to the AI trying to recreate the original artist&#39;s watermark.  People have also been using these prompt based AIs to scam people not in the know.  Which I believe is a type of scam that will only become more common in the future, as these become way more common and proficient in the future. <br><br>Lastly I hope I didn&#39;t come off as rude or anything.  I don&#39;t blame the people that have used AI art, many people don&#39;t really understand the work that goes into art.  If someone reading this has used AI art to generate like a DnD character or something for personal use then like, that&#39;s fine (maybe consider drawing them yourself for fun, who knows you may enjoy making art).  The core issue lies in the shady dealings these companies do, like Deviant Art force opting in all of their works on the site to a database to train an AI, and opting out doesn&#39;t even guarantee your work will be used.  And it doesn&#39;t help there are scammers selling AI art for profit without disclosing it&#39;s AI art, tech bros defending AI (with frankly rather extremely misinformed takes about why art is elitists because artists charge money for their work), and already having dealt NFTs for the past couple of years.  I just hope this gets regulated sooner rather than later to prevent the exploitation of artists!<br><br>tl;dr: it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s real art or not, there&#39;s exploitation afoot and that&#39;s something that can actually be solved.",-1

Not saying that they aren&#39;t superior for many things and still widely used, but there&#39;s no denying many are creating without them in the picture at all or only for selective elements. ie live drums. I think that same concept is going to emerge with animated moviemaking. Just as with music there are people that likely will be able to create meaningful animated movies as AI technology emerges in that field. <br><br>AI Art technology could have incredible impact in being used for teaching drawing/painting etc. Is there any formal initiative to help fight this battle for artists to maintain control of their art in regards to being used as data for commercial usage or otherwise? 3d modelers, animators etc are likely next to see this threat and should be joining in on establishing control over how their art is used.<br><br>Bakeries are far less common nowadays. 99% of furniture nowadays is not handmade.

As the tech matures, the latter can become very flexible and hence efficinet in form factor vs your standard individually owned oversized SUV. From personal pods to self driving buses depending on density and your travel needs. Streets, or at least dedicated lanes, similar to today&#39;s bus lanes, operating at maximum efficiency is a good thing whether those vehicles are publically or privately owned. You can use that efficiency to shrink the number of lanes needed in a city if it remains less efficient than tube/tram/rail, or to reduce the number of tube/tram/rail investments needed if it can beat them on efficiency. Or even just come close on efficiency given the huge convenience boost of bus type services gaining taxi characteristics.

Many artists end up not liking their own projects because of the pressure put on them.

The coloring, the textures, the shadows, were done mostly with programs that work from AI, which helped to carry the efforts to the most important parts such as background design, character design, story development, the improvement of the animation (handmade, of course), making options on how it could look in certain scenes so that the message could be transmitted with the heart, making visuals made with the soul, which despite the intervention of technology, is never replaced the humanity behind it.

Half of the reason people make art is so they can improve their skills so they can better express their ideas and experiences.

When you see an image knowing that it was made by AI, you just think ‚Äúhey this looks nice.‚Äù That‚Äôs it, it looks nice, and you already know that the reason it looks nice is because a machine made it, zero real effort was involved in making it. This is what people mean when they say AI art is soulless, it removes the part that gives art its value, its humanity. And by cutting out the part that makes art human, you are cutting out the part that makes art art. AI cannot improve, it cannot iterate, it cannot think, it cannot feel, so why should anything it creates be compared to the creations of those who can? Say what you want about me, but if you cannot value art outside of ‚Äúwell i just think it looks nice :)‚Äù then you don‚Äôt understand art.

Yes, many people do sell fan art and buy fan art (I do buy fan art) but there is legal action taken against artist on etsy often enough. Ethically, its better to not use others creations for profit.  But I also feel that creating fan art is an act of love, the intent matters. And often artists do not make significant income that I can&#39;t imagine it really does damage to IP holders (but they still have their rights too). <br><br>I&#39;m hoping to open my own shop and am using only original art. I do have some fan art made before I realized it was illegal but those I will give out as little gifts.  While, I have definitely taken inspo from artists I love, nothing is copied. I am trying to learn and develop my own line-less style of coloring. My own use of shapes. I am putting in time, thought, effort. As a musician I am sure you understand the process. <br><br>That to me is different from AI art, because AI isn&#39;t learning or improving or innovating. It doesn&#39;t make choices. I don&#39;t hate AI art or even those who use it for inspiration or personal projects. But I think its not genuine art because art is also the process not just the result.",-1

There is no need to have a driver&#39;s seat. <br>Therefore, there is no need to see the road directly. <br>Meaning the front can be a wall of foam or something designed to better allow a human to take impact upon an accident.<br>If the people inside want to see outside. <br>You could include a screen at an upward or downward angle above or to the side them. <br>Assuming that the suspension is able to be modified by the computer of the car. <br>One aspect to better prepare for impact would be to allow the change of expansion and angle of the suspension. <br>Essentially, changing the angle of the load applied and therefore impact that the falling material would apply to the car based off of what is falling.<br>I think it would be better to design the car itself with features like these to better handle the event of something like this. <br> then it would be far more practical than making a choice on where it would crash into. <br>As choosing who to hit is more of a dilemma most humans themselves would not have the reaction time to even change direction in the event of something like this happening. Therefore by applying that concept. It is just better to design the car itself with more features in the event of an impact than it would be to &#39;choose who to hit.&#39;. <br>As this avoids the moral question and possible discrimination in these events. <br>And only truly focuses on increasing the survivability of the crash and its impact on those around it and inside the car. <br>Because you must remember if you swerve you are not only endangering those who you are turning into.<br>It is also endangering those who are behind them. Thus assuming many vehicals are self driving at this point. <br>What you are essentially doing is telling the cars to produce a chain reaction. <br>For example: My car turns and smacks into another car. <br>The car behind that one can&#39;t stop, so it then turns into another car beside it. <br>This can go on for quite a while This is how car pileups happen.<br>Producing damage on a far larger scale, and increasing the chances of losing life significantly. <br>However, by taking the impact directly. <br>The smart car behind can see what has happened. <br>And since almost an insane load would be required to directly stop a car. <br>There would be more time for the car behind to react. <br>So, the idea of making a car change direction quickly to avoid it is already a bad idea.<br>Especially when you are considering the idea of many of these cars on a highway. <br>As all this would do is cause a human-like error. which it was designed to avoid.<br>Which would then possibly cause a far greater chance of death, injury, and destruction of property to everyone behind and the original people in the car itself. As emergency personnel are limited in these cases and having more injured to deal with leads to more people who can&#39;t be saved.<br>As such if this is a self-driving car. <br>The very first thing we should do is design it as such and design a specific mold for them to follow. <br>And simply by removing the need for a windshield, it would already add a lot more safety in the event of something like this happening. <br>As for in case of something like this happening. <br>You could directly design the front with a far more sturdy material.<br>Along with a non-rushed form of padding more suitable for taking impact.<br>As an impact from the front or back would become the most likely form of impact. <br>Which would be significantly better than what we are currently using. (Airbags.)<br>Then the ability to change the angle of the suspension of the car can directly assist how much impact is applied to a person inside. <br>Considering the concept of leverage, or even adding another angle to the axel of a tire. <br>Which would be unlocked in the event of a crash. Allowing a far greater amount of smoothening of the impact.  <br>Everything considered, it is better to directly design the vehicle as what it is and simply include features that make sense. <br>This isn&#39;t a question of morality, or of who to choose to receive damage. <br>As the requirements of a self-driving vehicle are fundamentally different from one being driven by a person, And computers could directly estimate the load of the impact, and control many more variables than a human could at the same time. As humans only have 2 hands and 2 feet, a computer could do what it takes over 100 humans to do at the same moment.<br>We would just need to design it with more of these features.  <br>You can directly change the design to better reflect what it actually is making the end product much more effective while being safer. <br>Which will allow functionality that was not possible before. <br>instead of making up moral problems, we are better off designing something as it actually is. <br>If we can truly not design something this way. <br>Then we no longer have a moral problem, it becomes one of common sense.<br>You don&#39;t design a pencil as a rubberband because it is impractical.  Could you? yes? <br>However when you design a pencil as a pencil. <br>It tends to function a lot better. <br>it should be less about morality and more about common sense... along with some innovation, and re-using things that have already been made in new ways.",-1

Any artist can do the same thing, make artwork inspired in someone else&#39;s style, the difference is that AI is able to do that much faster. People also train their own &quot;model&quot; by consuming a lot of art from other artists. That&#39;s not stealing, and AI isn&#39;t much different from that. The better the AI application, the more &quot;original&quot; the artwork will seem, and the same applies to humans. The beauty in art is largely in the eye of the beholder. If you value certain aspects, such as the effort and sensibilities of the author, you can keep buying art that way and that&#39;s great. But if you don&#39;t value those aspects, if art is mainly about the way it makes you feel, then AI art can become a more affordable way to find whatever fulfils your needs. And that&#39;s also great. Baking may also be perceived as a form of art and automation allowed companies to mass-produce with very little human intervention. Many people prefer handmade bread, though. So they&#39;ll keep buying it and that&#39;s fine. The problem is that some people see Art as something exclusive to humans, some special ability with transcendental qualities, and that&#39;s just not true.

Even worse, total employment rates have also started to decline, especially after 2008. There is one thing for sure, in terms of total hours, we are working less, much less, and the trend has no sign of slowdown. Total number of jobs did not decrease because of drastic decreases working hours per capita accompanied with increasing productivity, as well as marketization of domestic work. Funny thing is that there is no more room to go. Practically all domestic work is already marketed, there are more single people than married already. There is no more child labor to rid, while the number of retirees working are no more shrinking but on the rise. Given all that, unemployment is bound to rise, employment is bound to decrease.

relevant,"I mean, its hard to predict the future of AI, but here is the best I can think of, given the assumption that AI will become so smart that it can do all the jobs of humans, better than humans:<br>1) all people will loose their cash paying jobs (most obvious one)<br>2) no job = no money (also very obvious)<br>3) no money = can&#39;t buy anything (obviously)<br><br>HOWEVER, this is where my view takes a different turn than for most people, most people look at it from the perspective of what happens to themselves, and they think they will starve to death. However, it is not that simple, and I will explain why:<br>4) since (almost) noone has any money to pay anything, no one can sell any products or services either.<br>5) most of, if not all businesses will collapse as they can&#39;t make any money. The ones collapsing are those relying on income from the bottom majority of society.<br>6) since all businesses directed towards the public masses collapsed, there won&#39;t be any major products for the bottom majority people to buy by medium sized companies. They can&#39;t sell anything either, because even if they owned anything, they wouldn&#39;t be able to offer anything of value to someone who could afford it and doesn&#39;t already have that.<br><br>So my prediction is, whether or not the government decides to come in with UBI, What AI is killing the one thing that holds our society together - money. This chain of reaction will lead to a hyperdeflation. As more and more AI takes over, people will in theory earn less, so companies will be able to charge less. At the &quot;event horizon&quot; before singularity, we will approach a society where everything is for &quot;free&quot; (free as in not costing money), at which money goes from being almost infinitely valuable to being completely worthless, just like oil in the future will go up in price as it becomes more scarce until a point where people stop buying oil because they can&#39;t afford it, so oil companies give up trying to pump more oil from the ground.<br><br>This society will consist of two classes - the bottom majority and the top minority. For the bottom majority, they will not be able to buy services from eachother and may have to rely on themselves for their needs - <br>grow their own food, generating their own energy, performing medical care on themselves etc. On the other side you have the top majority, which are the ones operating and building their AI. They will be the ones who own all the factories, all the facilities, and all the AI servers. They have managed to adapt to a moneyless society and are now no longer selling any products or services for cash, but are instead bartering with others within the top majority.<br><br>Now, these AI will take alot of resources and will try to take advantage of any resource they can, so a possible prediction for the dystopia is that people from the bottom majority will have to work as slaves for the top minority in exchange of getting access to all the various services the giant companies provide. There will be only one job left for people - to use their physical body to produce electricity. That is the only valuable thing we have to offer that can&#39;t be replaced by AI, since AI needs maximum energy consumption for maximum delivery, so even if the energy from peoples movements are a drop in the ocean, the top minority is more than happy to enslave them to produce that tiny percentage of energy.<br><br>You could also possibly divide the bottom majority into the slaves and the &quot;outsiders&quot;. The outsiders are those not willing to work for the top majority for free and are instead trying to become independent and survive on their own - by growing their own food, fixing their own electricity etc. They have somehow learned to provide for their needs without any services and products provided by the top minority, but, they will have to live a life of struggle as they will be all on their own.<br><br>So, key points:<br>- Society will consist of two classes - Top minority and the Bottom majority, which can be divided into two subclasses - slaves and outsiders.<br>- money will completely loose its meaning - instead people will do bartering. For the top minority, bartering will be a no brainer since they can just use their AI to generate a complex bartering deal leading to a win-win for both parties. This was the main reason we went from bartering to currency in the past - because bartering deals were just too complicated and messy. With AI this is not going to be a problem anymore.<br>- Between the top minority and bottom majority, any deal will always be paid by the bottom majority with energy.<br>- The difference between slaves and outsiders is that slaves are dependent on the products and services provided by the top minority and so have to be ruled by them for survival, while outsiders will disconnect from society completely.",-1

Except<br><br>1/ not everyone is fit to be their own creators. Some are more fit to be just specialized technicians. The same way than not everyone is fit to be a leader/director/president.<br><br>2/ even if they were, there&#39;s gonna be a flood of new content that will just completely overwhelm the audience (I already almost never open my Netflix, just because the homepage with its infinite doomscrolly list of shows looks damn intimidating to me, and sometimes, I let 3 months pass with me paying the goddamn monthly fee without opening once the goddamn site, so imagine if all of a sudden, the whole goddamn world becomes a director and with the help of ever more efficient AI, everybody starts to make their own shows, and the flood will be that much more overwhelming. You said it yourself : supply already overthrows demand). So that means everybody will be a director/producer of a show/movie/animation/documentary/album that nobody will watch, because if you can grow the amount of creators, you can&#39;t grow the amount of audience in the world, neither can you grow the free time they&#39;ve got to consume art in general.<br><br>3/ And in the meantime artistic skills can only be maintained, or levelled up by repetition and actual long and hard work, which means having to do it as a full time job. Which won&#39;t happen if nobody can make a living out of it, so, unless UBI becomes a thing fast, in every category (musical, written and visual), human art in and of itself will fall aside in the side gig category, the fun hobby status, which will in turn pull the brakes hard on innovation and originality, since people will have to find another low pay full time job to just stay alive, and be exhausted at the end of the day to create anything, leading to the effective end of human art. <br>All of a sudden, I wish Andrew Yang became president...<br><br>PS : Funny thing is that on this video about AI, your voice timber sounds a lot like one of those robots voices that we can hear in generic tech reviews bot channels vids ^^.<br>Not a critic, your delivery was great.

relevant,"Most interesting commentary made here, very good insight and conclusions made about this controversy.<br><br>In my opinion, from past experience where I personally went through 4 years of commercial art- illustration career training back in the late 1960&#39;s and early 1970&#39;s using traditional media for creation, technological change has created new opportunities by destroying older forms.     I recall back in the 1960‚Äôs and 1970‚Äôs how illustrations and advertising art were created using tools that are today to a large degree obsolete.   These older tools took much more time learning and practice to use effectively.   Such things like rub on graphic letters, color separation on transparent mylar type sheets, and other tools for print ready products.    The use of computers and software made most of these old techniques and job skills obsolete.     <br><br><br>The problem with this change is that the human mind and ability to keep up is not always there.    There are some things that one can easily transition to and from yet others that are not within an individual‚Äôs abilities to migrate.   We all have things we are good at and not too good at.    You need a lot of luck, kind of like beating the odds at winning the lottery to keep a stream of success continuing through technological change that displaces long learned valuable skills.    Looking at past precedent and historical evidence throughout time, most generations lived in an era where a set of job skills would last a lifetime and were valuable for survival and making a living, change came slow and more easily comprehended.   The present generation on the other hand has seen too many changes in one lifetime that has totally disrupted valuable job skills to make a living and put humans into the shackles of constantly spending valuable time and money keeping up with the rat race of accelerated change.   Hard earned learning skills and education have a much shorter life cycle of use in today&#39;s fast changing technological pace of moving forward.    This pace will continue to accelerate as a necessary means of survival as the world&#39;s population continues to grow exponentially and a means of managing the growth is crucial.    <br><br>In all fairness a lot of changes do provide convenience and make things easier yet at the same time de-values any worth for some time, effort and dedication towards the acquiring of any skills.     Honestly, has all this technological change really improved our lives in a measurable degree that makes all the efforts to keep up with the rat race worthwhile?   Bottom line being a worthwhile investment.    Would the other possible outcome be more in line with the reality of what all this change is doing to our human race?   Are we simply making things more complicated and mentally fatiguing as it destroys our ability to make a living and forces one to constantly learn new skills that are like rolling the dice?<br><br>Is there a possible connection with how all this technological change is destroying human morale and leading to more hopelessness and loss of confidence in one&#39;s ability to make a living from personally developed skills that are valuable in the marketplace?   Seems the rate of worldwide protest in opposition to different things is growing increasingly in this generation along with an increase in crime and corruption within most countries and people roaming around the world being displaced out of desperation.<br><br>In all due fairness AI was not the biggest competition and challenge to creating art from scratch using traditional mediums or digital painting and drawing.   The same thing happened over a century ago when photography became available to the consumer.   Before photography many artists found work in portraiture since that was the only way to create a likeness of any visualization of a human as a means of memorabilia.    Likewise, yet to a lesser degree landscape paintings, and still life.    Photography won a large percentage in competition by replacing traditional medium art of drawing and painting for freelance and other established business means of making a living.",1

relevant,"Civilization may have progressed enough to conquer the second law of thermodynamics. Civilization needs to strive for this goal with synergistic interdisciplinary teams.The outcome would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. There would be no loss¬†of energy as it changes form. For example the total quantity of thermal energy in an equal pair of two thermal energy reserves with ideal insulation would remain the same regardless of how heat is distributed between the two and how often the distribution of heat between the two is changed. For example in oe case one reserve could contain ice water while the other reserve¬†contained hot water; in another case both reserves could contain tepid water. The redistribution of heat between members of pairs with the same total thermal energy would be free. Diversity, time, and energy are different atributes. Reversing disorder doesn&#39;t need time reversal just as using reverse gear in a car …ìacks it out without time reversal. <br><br>The second law of thermodynamics had a distinct begining with Sir Isaac Newton&#39;s correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flows towards the cold room beyond. <br><br>Victorian England became enchanted with steam engines and their cheap, reliable, and easy to¬†position physical power. Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Lord Kelven, and, one source adds, Nicolas L√©onard Sadi Carnot, formulated the Second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy using evidence from steam engine development. <br><br>These men considered with acceptance [A+] Inefficiently harnessing the flow of heat from hot to cold or [B+] Using force to Inefficiently pump heat from cold to hot. They considered with rejection [A-] Waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. This was calculated to be extremely rare or [B-] Searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small differences in temperature or pressure. The search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. These accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death.¬† This became support for a theological trend of the time that placed God as the initiator of a degenerating universe. Please consider that God could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. <br><br>The law&#39;s formulaters did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuations itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. Then the net power of many small fluctuations from many replicant parts can be aggregated into a large difference in temperature, pressure, or electricity&#39;s amperes and volts <br><br>Heat exists as the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecules or mobile electrons. In gasses this is known as Brownian motion. In electronic systems¬† this is carefully labeled Johnson Nyquist thermal electrical noise for AI readability. Hypothetically, diode depletion regions are¬† practical sites for enabling mobile electrons energized into motion by thermal electrical noise to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. The thermal electrical noise is hypothetically beyond the¬†¬† exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion)¬†¬†¬† equlibrium thickness of the depletion region; thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. <br><br>Consistantly oriented diodes in parallel hypothetically are successful electrical Maxwell&#39;s Demons or Smoluchowski&#39;s Trapdoors. The energy needed to shift the depletion region&#39;s deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. There would therefore be usable net rectified power from each and every diode connected together into a consistantly oriented parallel group. The group would aggregate the net power of its members. Any diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat, more efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is switched off has no energy conversion and no performance. <br><br>The power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor&#39;s own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square nanometer cells per square millimeter. <br><br>Modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers. <br><br>Zero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage. <br><br>Ever since the supposedly universal second law of thermodynamics was formulated, education has mass produced and spread the conventional wisdom throughout society that the second law of thermodynamics is absolute. <br><br>If counterexamples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electric motors with the mechanisms they¬†power, and electric ligts so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant. <br><br>Cell¬†phones wouldn&#39;t die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn&#39;t need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Electronic minting would be energy cheap. <br><br>Frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and p≈ïepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn&#39;t need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independent power. Shielding and separation would provide EMP resistance. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. <br>Zone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnideetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough clean cheanetary minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns. <br><br>This could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious and unified civilization.¬†It is possible to apply technlology wrong but social force should oppose this. <br><br>I filed for a patent, us 3890161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.¬† It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. <br><br>the patent wasn&#39;t developed because I backed down from commercial exclusitivity. A better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attrbution for the original works of creators. Uncorrupted copies would be released on request. No further action would be taken by this institution. <br><br>Commercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also the obvious is unpatentsable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom. <br><br>Many financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain here. <br><br>These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer commodities are inexpensive. <br><br>Aloha <br><br>Charles M Brown lll <br>Kilauea, Kauai, Hawaii 96754<br>1 808 651 üìûüìûüìûüìû",1

The move from hunter gather society to agriculture led to the concept of land ownership, food storage and domesticated cats, and mathematics and writing. It is also when we have the first record of enslaved humans. The industrial revolution replaced horses and humans with machines, created appalling pollution and deprivation and severed the connection between people and their lands and communities as populations urbanized. Most of our problems today can be traced to these two revolutions - the first because we have way more humans on the planet than we can sustainably maintain due to the relatively cheap foods that automated big-agro can produce, and the alienation and despair that modern urban populations suffer from all over the world. The two combined have brought us to a place where power and wealth have moved from the land-owning gentry, to the factory-owner, to the corporations whose power and wealth now supercede that of sovereign states. And all this was just as a result of the concept of the corporation, a legal fiction. So the manual worker and his horse got replaced by factory machinery and the train and the car, and the planet&#39;s homeostatis got replaced by our current runaway climate death spiral, and everyone thought it was great, unless you worked a dirty and dangerous job and lived in an overcrowded diseased slum in the newly booming cities. Then we replaced the grunt work in factories with robot automation and the resulting blue collar revolt nearly overthrew the world&#39;s most prosperous democracy and rule of law as a direct result.

You can create a myriad of incentive models to get artists to opt in, that&#39;s a huge discussion, but that&#39;s the main idea. Almost certainly, this would result in the model not being as good. The model not being as good doesn&#39;t prevent the tech moving forward. It ONLY stops it from freely exploiting the property of people.<br><br>2: At any point in time, artist should be able to blacklist their names from being invoked in image generators.

Someone smart has thought of this before. It&#39;s NOT being done for a reason. It is MEANT TO STEAL.<br><br>A few additional points - <br>This fight is currently about art, but everyone should be in favor of some common sense protections about the usage of data for AI in general. Right now this might seem benign to the average person who all in all doesn&#39;t care that much that this is stealing from artists. But understand that everyone has images of themselves all over the internet as well all over social media. Lots of it conveniently tagged with who is in the photo. What is all of this was put into a model and trained to be able to invoke your face by name? If anyone could create images of you, your children, your family, doing literally anything. If anyone could take your face and make and sell merch with it on it, then tell you they don&#39;t owe you anything, that your face was freely available on the internet, that it would be too hard to NOT use your face.<br><br>Now consider that for many artists, their art and their style is more central to their identity than even their face. There are many famous artists out there that hardly anyone knows what they look like, but they could recognize their work a mile away.

The rhetorical question asked to make a point is not being asked rhetorically by consumers: fields that can be automated with less effort, time, resources, sick leave, human messiness, etc. for profit absolutely will be. It&#39;s imminent.<br><br>2. Just because you love to create art doesn&#39;t mean you have to make a living out of it (although to make the art you want, it may take more time than you can spend as a hobby when you have a life and a job to make a living).<br><br>I don&#39;t think the problem is with AI. I don&#39;t think it should be restricted in any formal way.<br><br>I think the issue is with:  <br><br>A) Understanding our respective business models (as artsy-fartsy <i>Creatives‚Ñ¢).</i> If we&#39;re running businesses, then let&#39;s operate like we&#39;re running actual businesses. We should operate knowing our markets can and will change. We need to meet the needs of shifting markets. Our market to make a living may only be those who really want authentic, non-AI art and those who can afford our rates. And then we have to get into new market positions to sell our respective art. Or like other business fields, we may decide that we just can&#39;t turn a living and have to find new jobs. <br><br>B) Consumers needing to become more knowledgeable about what they consume and valuing art made by humans more than algorithm-approximated creations. In terms of plagiarism, AI-generated art should give credit and be held accountable. Voice acting is also running into this issue, where VO like myself have to decide to find ways to market to those wanting authentic voices and/or those who can afford our human rates. Or we give permission to use our performances to AI voice technology...for massive rates and royalties.<br><br>And bigger voices can and do sue for recreating a likeness that is too much like a performer with a distinctive voice like Samuel L. Jackson or Morgan Freeman.<br><br>I think artists have to get business-like and legal to not only protect themselves but to also net income from AI (and suing for using your art without permission, credit, and agreed upon compensation.)<br><br>The future may be that artists don&#39;t make as much art, because it&#39;s not in as high demand. But artists may still make their living on AI royalties. And you may still get to have a life that lets you take ample time to make your own art without the pressure of having to art for a living.",-1

The last (private) train I was on was also the most expensive per kilometer, but that&#39;s because it was a single-car diesel train that was effectively a bus on rails, and it still only cost me a few bucks / ¬•400 each way. The point is, I was able to get from somewhere to almost nowhere without leaving train stations and without relying on individual transport, and the experience wasn&#39;t entirely convenient (it was cold, and some of the waits between trains were pretty long), but it was easy and cheap.

This enhanced what music could be, despite what the traditionalists preached. BUT a fundamental thing in music is that the orchestra players have not been completely replaced, because digitized sound stil lacks the imperfections that give depth to sound, the variations in the way people play notes (even while singing) make it feel a little bit less repetitive to our ears. You can hire an orchestra still, but if you can&#39;t afford one, you can get a MIDI sound of orchestral instruments and go to town on a free program like LMMS to get yourself a little soundtrack to this game or animation you&#39;re making, for example.<br>My specific problem is that if you want art, but you can&#39;t afford it, now there&#39;s artificial intelligence that will copy the strokes of another person, the colors, the expressions, and give it to you for free.

While you&#39;re clearly right that AI isn&#39;t there at the moment, it is developing fast and will probably be there sooner than you appear to believe. Also, the kind of inaccuracies you&#39;re seeing <i>now</i> could easily be remedied with very cheap-to-produce digital signalling infrastructure (I&#39;m thinking markers or signallers to tell vehicles where static hazards are, lanes are, traffic light status, etc.). Finally, while computers aren&#39;t immune to error, they are far less prone to it than human brains and can think and react far faster.<br><br>That said, I do have to add that I don&#39;t think everyone owning a self-driving car is the answer, but I do believe self-driving vehicles of some kind have to be part of the eventual solution. Perhaps that might look like a combination of self-driving busses with some public cars for more specific needs? I&#39;m not claiming to have the final answer, I&#39;m just saying that the premise that self-driving would make stuff worse once fully developed is probably wrong.<br><br>I think there&#39;s a certain instinctive distrust people have of self-driving in general that comes from the sense of being out of control.

relevant,"To me (as a current C.S. Student, and 20 years of professional electronics and programming experience), the solution is actually quite simple.  Don&#39;t allow any A.I controlled vehicle to create a secondary accident.  The only choice is for the vehicle to crash into what is ahead of it.  First off, if the vehicle following the truck is following normal rules of driving (2-3 second rule), then there is no reason why the vehicle can not come to a stop before colliding with the objects falling from the truck.  If there was in-climate weather, than the 2-3 second rule should be adjusted accordingly, and it should still be able to stop.  If the owners of the vehicle did not perform proper maintenance to allow the vehicle to stop properly, then the occupants around them should not be penalized for the owners negligence.  In addition, if the vehicles around them are all A.I.controlled, then swerving into those vehicles could cause them to react in a way to create tertiary accidents.  If the initial vehicle maintains its course, those secondary and tertiary accidents are avoided.  Finally, with safety features of vehicles today (which I find annoying are cited in the video to justify a secondary accident, but not in defense of the vehicle hitting the objects falling from the truck), I feel it is more likely that the occupants of the vehicle will survive the accident, without the need to endanger anyone else around them.",-1

Even tho I want it to be one of a kind, I still get ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù from pictures that the people got off google. For example, I‚Äôm colorblind and I always loved Van Goghs art.

The people that are willing to spend 4 dollars to get some sloppy made art that‚Äôs not exactly what they wanted. They aren‚Äôt going to spend the $50 or more to get art from someone. Long story short I don‚Äôt see ai taking peoples jobs because first companies usually will not put up with having to be okay with the messed up hands and the blurry objects messed up.

Just wide swathes of asphalt, miles and miles accumulatively that just never get used by anyone. These monstrosities need to be remade to be liveable and walkable.

We are talking millions. Even programmers are in danger.<br><br>Middle class factory jobs (blue collar) was shipped over seas beginning in the 70&#39;s.

relevant,"I‚Äôm inclined to agree with those who have pointed out that your solution would require a large shift away from profit motives in order to work. The problem here is in reality not much different from those we face all over the economy. The issue would be of almost no consequence if it weren‚Äôt for the income loss to artists. With a corporation creating these art factories and keeping all the money, we end up with increasing wealth inequality, which is possibly the most consequential aspect of our current onmi crisis. Every artist whose income dries up is a cultural loss to all of society. It may not be one you notice, but add them all together and we get a shrinking pool of human creatives left to bring the truly novel ideas to light. Champions of the tech are too quick to embrace the cynical idea that these machines are the same as people. And like every sector that derives profit from shedding workers, they forget that if everyone is broke they can‚Äôt buy their products.
