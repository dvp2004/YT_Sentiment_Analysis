"&quot;If AI makes me an artist, then a microwave makes me a chef&quot;<br>- a wise internet artist",1
"What makes me most upset about this whole situation is how aggressively heartless people&#39;s reactions are. Not only do people not care, they celebrate the downfall of artists. It is said AI generated art lacks soul &amp; humanity... my dude, somewhere along the way society has ALREADY lost this",1
"The irony of AI art bros is that they tell us artists to shut up and deal with it, but they cry about ppl stealing or mimmicing their AI art prompts. The hypocrisy is hilarious.",1
"I am not related to art, I was just researching ai art for business purposes, I&#39;ve heard that artists are not happy about it and wanted to know why, and stumbled upon your video. Thank you for putting it out there. It honestly blows my mind how people refuse to understand and empathize with your struggle, even if you aren&#39;t an artist, it&#39;s not freaking hard to imagine what it&#39;s like to spend years working on your craft and produce a lot things, and then have those things stolen and the fruits of your labour being used for profit by others. Disgusting. Why the hell would anyone push against you in this matter?<br>Dear artists, please value yourself, you are a gift to the world and your work is immensely valuable, keep fighting for yourselves. I&#39;m a regular person but I will take any chance that I get to speak for your benefit and do what I can to help.",-1
"I&#39;m tired of not knowing if an art piece is AI or not. When I see something I like, I want to be able to find the artist to see more of their work. Now I feel like the only thing I see is AI art and it creates so much distrust for me on the internet, when it&#39;s become so difficult to tell them apart - what&#39;s made by an AI and what&#39;s made by real human beings.<br>I tend to not feel like using any art websites because I have such mixed feelings whenever I go on there. Like pinterest and deviantart among others... it makes me really sad.",-1
Calling artists gatekeepers for not liking AI is like calling runners gatekeepers because they won&#39;t let you use your car in a foot race.,0
"If you do some study about the music business in last 100 years, you‚Äôll find a big chunk of it is about how talents are being taken advantage of by the business men. But slowly musicians fought back. I think you‚Äôre absolutely right and it‚Äôs time for artists to do the same. Sadly there‚Äôs no easy path.",-1
"As someone who wants to pursue art as a carrier, I am so glad you&#39;re putting your voice out there and addressing this issue. It comforts me and gives me hope that maybe it&#39;s not all over for my dream future.",1
"When I was young, I was told I had to get ‚Äúa real job‚Äù because artists don‚Äôt make any money.  After decades of fighting my natural desire to create, I have finally started making art again.  I am much happier making art, but I‚Äôm sure not making any money.  It‚Äôs not just young people struggling to find a market for their art!  Now when artists put our art out there in order to find a market, we just end up getting our images ripped off by AI.  This old lady is mad too!",1

I ended up having an argument with Gemini AI as it wouldn&#39;t show me &#39;Happy White Couple&#39; as I shouldn&#39;t focus on race but when I requested a &#39;Happy Black Couple&#39; they were more than willing to provide images and very much happy to do so üòÇüòÇüòÇ,1

They mostly hate drawing/painting and simply don&#39;t want to put in the effort, but they crave recognition and attention. Same with writing. You don&#39;t have to look far, because Amazon is currently flooded by so-called &quot;writers&quot; generating stories for profit, without ever writing a coherent paragraph in their life.<br>At the same time,  real people doing real art suffer, because this crap floods their markets.

It was a lot more complicated, but I was able to do it after a few months of setup and testing several automated processes. I was even able to have AI complete a complicated monthly analysis report that involved data from several different systems and many calculations that normally took me several hours to complete. It could complete the complex report within minutes and it was automated to run the report daily rather than monthly and update results to a dashboard with data visualizations. This is the reality of AI in the workplace and hopefully this gives you an idea of how company leaders are using it.",1

"Getting into jobs that are less automatable is sensible, but not sustainable. Long term, it won&#39;t be all that &#39;good advice&#39; for the masses who&#39;ll be displaced by AI. Rather than a solution, it&#39;ll be used as a dismissal. So we need to focus more on making major policy changes, to ensure everyone benefits from AI, not just the few who can still find jobs AI can&#39;t take.",1

"I published a study last year about the average working hours per capita in the US between 1900 and 2020 (unfortunately not in English), which has found that the average (and total) paid working hours has shrunk 30% in the US (more drastic in Europe). To make things worse, housework has shrunk by 70-80% and child labor is virtually eliminated. On top of that, people over 65 had a drastic drop in their employment rate from 65% to a mere 20%. Even worse, total employment rates have also started to decline, especially after 2008. There is one thing for sure, in terms of total hours, we are working less, much less, and the trend has no sign of slowdown. Total number of jobs did not decrease because of drastic decreases working hours per capita accompanied with increasing productivity, as well as marketization of domestic work. Funny thing is that there is no more room to go. Practically all domestic work is already marketed, there are more single people than married already. There is no more child labor to rid, while the number of retirees working are no more shrinking but on the rise. Given all that, unemployment is bound to rise, employment is bound to decrease. Whether it will be a catastrophe or a moderate crisis depends on productivity increases and the type of automation, robotic developments as well as government policies.",-1
You all have been rocking it lately!! Thanks for all the great fun-learn!,1
Amazing content. I love the consistency and the catchy interesting videos. Also love that you decided to show your face. For a few of the last videos I started to think this was just a custom AI cause your voice control was so on point lol,1
"I‚Äôm not convinced. However, I do agree the transition will take a lot longer than a lot of people think. <br><br>The biggest disagreement I have with you is that you consider AI to be simply another technology. Like a new printer or an AC. <br><br>We‚Äôre attempting to create brains here. The whole reason we want ever more things is because we have brains and a capacity to think and create. If humanity achieves AGI, it doesn‚Äôt matter what other technologies we might want. The AI will simply create them for us, organise the supply chain alone, find a way to manufacture them, etc.<br><br>It truly is bound to be our last technology in my opinion. Now, of course that doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôll lay around doing nothing all day. But I think the types of jobs that will exist will be very few and scattered apart.<br><br>Because, again, it fundamentally doesn‚Äôt matter what we humans might want. AGI can think, create, organise, plan and manufacture it for us. <br><br>It only depends how long (if ever) you think AGI will take to create.",1
You do great job! I just saw a first video of yours a few hours ago and then couldn&#39;t stop but to continue listening to the next like 6-7...,1
"Allow self driving vehicles to communicate with one another. That way, in such a scenario, multiple vehicles could work in unison to allow a safe pathway out for the car in danger. This would, of course, require very rapid communication between the vehicles. It would significantly lower the chances of this happening, but not prevent it in every instance.",1
At first I would have crashed into the motorcyclist with the helmet cause of the lower risk but after realizing that I‚Äôm hitting the driver just because they are following the rules and being cautious it really hit me.,1
The system should deploy its hidden rocket launchers to blow the boxes up.,-1
The future where cars dish out street justice haha,1
"Now here&#39;s another ethical dilemma: When we get to the point that most cars are self-driving and are 10 times less likely to have an accident, should humans even be allowed to drive on public roads at all?",1
"I just want to say I think this is a beautifully realized piece of communication. The pace of information flow is accessible without being patronizing, the text is very well structured and delivered, and the graphics and music support it perfectly. Good job, people!",1
"This video brought up a lot of points I hadn&#39;t considered about self driving vehicals. Very interesting topic, I&#39;m curious as to where it will lead.",1
"This is very interesting to think about. It also raises an assumption here: In this scenario, if all cars were self-driving, could they sense everything around them or not? If so, the other cars may be able to &#39;see&#39; this event happening and account for it to move out of the way to make a gap for the oncoming car that would otherwise hit the object. However that seems to assume a perfect overseeing system, probably too difficult to create at this stage. Awesome to think about tho",1
"That is if you only see 3 options. I see more. <br><br>If the other cars on the road are also self driving, they can all instantly start to make way for you to minimize damage and there is a good chance everyone can walk away.<br><br>Otherwise, you can still swing towards the car, but not smach him. Just get mostly out of the way of the falling thing.<br><br><br><br>And blame goes to whoever tied down that load.Ôªø",1
The real question is why that self driving car is tailgating the semi.,1
"The real threat is that regulators will try to ban traditional cars.  You‚Äôre not taking my Mustang, or my gunsüòâ",1
Improving technology isn&#39;t a bad thing as long as it does not become a requirement.,-1
Driverless cars appear to do well in those areas where climate is nice most of the year. How are they going to do in cities with harsh winters and strong winds and blinding rains and flooded streets?,1
I&#39;m not scared of driverless cars. I&#39;m scared of regulators banning me from driving myself.,0
"My only fear with autonomous vehicles is that once the technology is good enough, and accepted by the public, that government will ban humans from driving cars. Or they will make the requirements for a drivers license so enormous, that most people simply won&#39;t be able to obtain one.",1
"Driverless cars = total control of your movement, or no movement at all if you think the wrong way.",-1
I want to see them take on an average Minnesota winter üòÇü§£,-1
I can foresee in my lifetime the banning of human-driven cars on the grounds of safety or traffic flow. It will start on certain roads and expand from there. As a car enthusiast and libertarian this just fills me with despair :(,-1
"First we have the self-driving cars, then we&#39;ll have legislation that restricts cars with human drivers. Next, the only thing you&#39;ll be able to have is a driverless car. Then they&#39;ll decrease the supply of them. They&#39;ll shut them off whenever they feel like. You will be at their mercy. But it&#39;ll all be for our safety!",1
I like the idea of driverless cars. What I don&#39;t like is the slippery slope that automated cars create. Eventually this could cause insurance costs to sky rocket and/or enable the government to restrict the use of standard cars in order to control the population,0
&quot;Our vehicles don&#39;t get distracted.&quot;<br>That means nothing if your vehicle cannot interpret how to drive through a construction zone. <br>My flashlight doesn&#39;t get distracted or drunk either but I don&#39;t claim it can drive.,-1
"I almost joined Cruise as a software engineer a few years ago.<br>These things have a long road ahead to be safe and trusted.<br>The best solution at the moment is,<br>Driverless only roads and roads with digital infrastructure (sensors and such) which would help the driverless car make a decision",1
I think self driving cars can be good for me. I‚Äôm handicapped can not drive. The transportation service in my town are awful. I can‚Äôt go anywhere by my self unless somebody drives me.,-1

"I went to Philly for my cousin&#39;s wedding and rented a car that (surprise) had lane assist. On the drive from Philly to Atlantic City I encountered toll booths (where 2-3 lanes suddenly became 7) unpainted lanes, and very narrow roads. The lane assist fought me, almost yeeted me into another car, and was a general pain in the butt. I didn&#39;t notice it on wider, well-maintained roads because presumably the car had a better idea of where the lane actually was and wasn&#39;t having a panic attack. <br>These systems clearly rely on very specific information and break down the nano-second that information isn&#39;t available.",1
"Man, if only we had some sort of thing where there&#39;s like one person up at the front where the engine is. Maybe we could call them the &quot;Engineer&quot; , and then everyone else can just live, and sleep in the cars while they&#39;re moved around. Wait a minute..",1
I&#39;m gonna wait until they get a spell checker that works before I start thinking about self driving cars.,0
"ok, people who make excuses that &quot;a cardboard cutout isn&#39;t a real human&quot; need to have their heads examined.  If your car drives over a huge object in the middle of the road, THAT&#39;S A FUCKING PROBLEM.  It&#39;s not like the car can tell what the object is made of, or what is BEHIND the cardboard cutout.  For all you know it&#39;s a brick wall, or something worse.  What if there actually IS a real child behind the cardboard ??  The fact that the car doesn&#39;t stop at the sight of any object in front of it is already a failure of massive proportions.",-1
"&quot;a self-driving only lane&quot; implies that your home, and everywhere else you want to go, is attached to a self-driving road. if you have two road networks, they have to be fully separated. they can&#39;t overlap and be separate at the same time, unless one lane is underground or flying.<br><br>also consider that most cities can&#39;t afford the maintenance on the roads they have already.",1
I was a truck driver for  a year. The safety features could be terrifying and more dangerous. A truck I was driving slammed on the brakes going 65 mph with cars behind and next to me because it thought a crack was a reason to stop. I could have jacknifed into someone. Another time it died under an overpass because it thought there was a low bridge there it couldn&#39;t go under... so it was safer to be stopped in 55mph traffic because there was an imaginary low brige there.  Tthe safety department would just blame the driver with the claim computers don&#39;t make errors humans do. Luckily I was never in an accident but the safety features sure tried to get me into one.,-1
"I love the boyds example, but when I think about the idea for a separate lane or highway for self driving vehicles, I just want the lane to be a TRAIN.",1

The cars are very long and multiple of them are put together, so only one person is needed to monitor the car going through the tunnel, and a few hundred passengers can sit down, being self-driven.<br><br>It&#39;s called the &quot;metropolitan line downtown segment&quot;.",1

"As an engineer I always thought I knew where this was headed and envisioned a near-ish future where workers in factories, burgerking and mcdonalds are completely replaced by robots. Ironically I have worked in computer vision and machine learning myself, yet I did not see this coming. What I have seen and heard in the past months made me extremely depressed. I had no idea that artists of all things were headed to the chopping block. And I am technically on the &quot;tech side&quot; yet it breaks my heart - I can&#39;t imagine how some artists must feel. We have created it and there is no way of undoing it.",-1
"&quot;Create something worth imitating&quot; If you do that, your work will just be fuel for the AI.",1
I just saw an article yesterday where the US Copyright Office stated AI generated art can‚Äôt be copyrighted which I found interesting.,1
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USsh-XK6s6U&amp;t=696"">11:36</a> yes. I want to make art because I want to share it with an audience that loves it. I want to connect with them and make them connect with each other over my piece of work. But suddenly I cannot share it with anyone. Whatever I will think of, It will have been already cooked up by AI. The ideas I have had for years, characters, designs and stories, that I have put blood sweat and tears into, when I finally get them out, they might already exist, (or at least something very similar), and claimed by some random person who accidentally prompted them. That&#39;s where we are headed. There is no place for human creativity there. In my case, me making art for only me to enjoy, it&#39;s just not fully why I do it. I don&#39;t really care about money, I just care about what I do, to be able to support itself and my very modest living, so I can only focus on making my art.",1
"well, you know. I‚Äôve been a professional musician for almost 30 years now. whenever I feel really bad, I pick up an instrument and sing to it. nothing makes me feel more alive and grounded. AI will never take that from me, and that‚Äôs good enough.",1
"The real gestalt of a live performance is watching, hearing and feeling the musicians cooperate with each other improvising in the moment......",1
"I feel like musicians, visual artists and all creators should unite against this unethical technology. If we stand together and defend our justice, then we will be able to change something. The future is in our hands",1
"The interesting development in AI is that, as you reference, the utopian view is that ultimately AI will take over the menial labour tasks to free us humans up to do deep and enriching creative work.<br><br>The trend is almost the opposite‚Äîeverything AI is producing that is making news is ostensibly creative work (albeit a kind of facsimile of previous created works). I wonder if it&#39;s the low stakes and imprecise nature of creative work that actually makes it a better kicking off point than high stakes precise work (driving, for example).",1
"You‚Äôll be surprised to learn that this isn‚Äôt just a matter of AI music. AI can generate literally 100% of anything you could possibly interact with online. It can write code, create users, content, webpages, proxies, at nearly instantaneous speeds. It can position a node as a port through every single device connected to the internet, and a 2 sec. delay in ‚Äúspotty ‚Äú internet connection is enough for a node to manipulate any information you‚Äôre about to see. All of these nodes are connected, so not only is it omnipotent, it‚Äôs omnipresent.. who cares whether it‚Äôs omniscient. It probably is, but if it isn‚Äôt it will be.. and if it is, it happened a long time ago. We are so confident in what is fed to our eyes that we don‚Äôt even think to question what has the ability to appear 100% real and yet be 100% fake and specific to your eyes.",1

And the Grammy for best song goes to: The computer.,1
Think about the ramifications of AI generated &quot;music&quot; and &quot;art&quot;!  I don&#39;t want to live in a world where the human experience and human creativity is devalued.  Because the value of music and art isn&#39;t just the money somebody makes from its consumption.  It is the life blood of the artist.  It is purpose and fulfillment which is absolutely wasted on a toaster.,-1

Interesting how artists were called overdramatic for reacting to the AI apocalypse but when it&#39;s affecting other fields of art suddenly everyone takes it seriously. Just find that interesting,1
"I‚Äôm a musician, and I definitely do fear this topic. AI can be an incredible tool for filling in the gaps in like mixing and mastering (like LANDR), but what makes a musician is not only creativity but skill as well. Dedicating hours to training ur body to play an instrument, sing, learn your DAW, learning composition, etc. are all part of the journey of being a musician.<br><br>I already kind of have this stance with sampling. I hear some amazing and creative uses of samples (I use them myself, as does practically everyone), but the average ‚Äúbeat maker‚Äù truly feels like a talentless hack. I‚Äôve watched ppl just put a beautiful sounding loop in with some basic 808 pattern and call themselves talented with no understanding of why that sample sounds good to begin with. Letting AI make lyrics, make ur melodies, etc., it all just seems like a mask for ppl with no skill or dedication to pretend to be skilled.<br><br>Ik I m probably sound elitist or gatekeeping but it‚Äôs just my perspective given my experience.",1
Happy New Year Cleo. Your content is awesome - keep it going üëèüëèüëèüëè,1
All previously invented technologies have been tools for artists to use. AI is the first tool to be able to replace the artist themself.,1
"The biggest problem I see with AI in any creative space is not that it can make things, but the amount of that thing it can create, an AI can create thousands of songs in the time it takes a human to write and record one and out-compete humans just through sheer volume, burying human work under piles of AI stuff and making it undiscoverable, even things like tags etc that might be used to highlight human-made work only work as long as those uploading AI-produced work are being honest.<br>With how easily recorded works can be produced by AI now, we might see a return to how musicians got their fame and money before recording was widely available, performance, before AI comes for that too.",1

"Idk man ever since AI popped up i feel like i want to be an artist even harder than before. To me, the point of making art is making art, and art to me has always been about overcoming expectations. <br>Im not at all good to this point, but fuck it I&#39;m having fun with my watercolors and no AI will change that lol",1
"Man, it still sucks that Kim Jung Gi is gone,  guy was my inspiration",-1
"I don&#39;t care that people use AI, I just hate when people use it to steal other people&#39;s unfinished art and post it like it was always their own work. An artist was live streaming his work when someone took a screen shot of it and then put it through an AI program to finish it faster than him and then had the audacity to claim the streamer stole his work.",-1
"To artists,<br>don&#39;t fear that AI will replace the entire art industry. People who want human art will always want human art.

You got Luddite right eventually! Facsimile is fax-im-illy. The pronunciation gives us the abbreviation &quot;FAX&quot; machine,1
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdgGwDsN0xI&amp;t=643"">10:43</a> Expanding on this a bit: when I saw Gil Scott-Heron a couple of years before his death, he told this story about how jazz was originally called &#39;jism music&#39; because it was made to entertain folks in brothels in New Orleans while they were waiting for their turn. Around the same time, someone stole a shipment of brass instruments, and soon enough everyone in the ghetto miraculously started playing the trumpet or the saxophone. They weren&#39;t brass musicians, because they didn&#39;t have any formal training, so folks called them &#39;ass musicians&#39;. There was a lot of crossover between jism and ass in those days, and when it went mainstream in the late 1910s, early 1920s, people didn&#39;t want to seem crass, so they just called it jazz. Anyway, Adam Neely is my favourite jism and ass bassist",1
"Music is probably the ONE area where I feel optimistic regarding AI. It will mark a transition (or rather, return back) to understanding music primarily as a social activity rather than a consumable product. AI will render recorded music basically obselete; imagine ultra high quality music being composed IN REAL TIME based on your personal preferences! But AI cannot replace the experience of live music, of flesh-and-blood people interacting with physical instruments.",1
John Henry folklore correction: He didn&#39;t compete with a locomotive. The race was John with a hammer and chisel-like drill bit vs a steam powered jackhammer in a rock drilling contest. The holes were part of the process of creating railroad tunnels through mountains.,0
"As a professional, working visual artist noticing the rise in AI art these past couple months, I think the majority of artists more so are irritated with it‚Äôs marketing as a replacement of professional artists rather than as a tool for artists. Having AIs ‚Äúlearn‚Äù on databases of licensed/copyrighted artwork made by living concept artists, where the OG artists receive no compensation or credit, makes the entire situation seem more like executives and studio heads just want to receive content and never pay the artists. A lot of these AI concepts even pick up entire sections of peoples artwork and basically plagiarize them. I can be inspired by other people‚Äôs work, sure, but if I started tracing entire sections of my favorite artists line for line, most people would call me out for stealing someone‚Äôs work, and rightfully so. If I write a song that‚Äôs inspired by Sungazer‚Äôs playing style, that‚Äôs fair game, but if I start just taking bass lines and merely transplant them into a slightly modified song, I think it would be kinda scummy. We can argue all day if this is real art or real music, but what‚Äôs far more important is the effect is has financially on working artists. If your albums were fed into a learning model (without compensation), and then that learning model was marketed as ‚ÄúHey, you can ‚Äòmake‚Äô a song in the style of Adam Neely,,‚Äù it‚Äôs not really a tool meant to benefit you, the artist, anymore, like MIDI or recorded music, or photoshop and 3D programs for visual artists - it‚Äôs meant explicitly to replace you.",1
The irony that we&#39;re automating the production of art instead of the jobs everybody hates shouldn&#39;t be lost on us.,0
"for all the real musicians out here, nothing will kill the joy of musicians making music together jamming",1

So glad I&#39;m 62 and grew up listening to real music! Enough with  fixing everything to death. Let&#39;s go back to singers who could sing and players who could play. Imperfections are beautiful and the risks are thrilling.,1
"Some Pop music has been so quantized, processed and formulated that it might as well be AI.",0
"RB, Profound gratitude for the video and keeping us updated on developments.  I hope there&#39;ll always be a place for human musicians who play live music.",1
"So far, those AI clips have all the personality as a Casio preset.",1

I think that another effect of this is that a minority of people will value small local bands playing live even more. It‚Äôs the human connection that will matter. They‚Äôll be the people who care.,1
"Universal could fracture the streaming services by pulling their content, Spotify could generate their own artists, etc etc. The truly sad part is that none of it has anything to do with music and music making.",1
"I read a lot of comments about how &quot;AI will never replace the human connection&quot;, but I think those desires will become niche. I think within a fairly short timeframe AI will become so good, it will start to offer songs that are generated specifically for an individual&#39;s tastes, the same way that platforms like YT or Spotify are already pretty good at predicting new content that may interest you. <br><br>The difference here will be that the content will be iteratively generated based on your preferences, so it may end up that people aren&#39;t even listening to the same songs, but rather what the AI guesses you want in a new song, based on things you have liked in the past. This may be especially true considering most modern music consumption is personal - portable players, streaming accounts, headphones rather than group consumption (concerts, clubs, speakers).",1
This Ai is distorting our sense of what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs not.  And you can‚Äôt even tell what‚Äôs different.  It‚Äôs hella dangerous.,-1
The fact that current artists like Drake have been heavily processing their voices through Auto-tune and everything else that makes them sound like a computer has come back to bite them in the ass. It&#39;s made it REALLY easy to clone their voices through these AI programs.,1
Great video. It‚Äôll even affect live music as AI plugins will simply change the tonality of a singers voice on the fly. I agree that people will probably always want to feel the awe that comes with experiencing real talent and will look for ways to differentiate between real voice and AI voice. Interesting times.,1
Two weeks ago Boris Elgadsen won the Sony world photography award for a piece titled The Electrician. He forfeited the award because the work was AI generated and submitted it to prove the competition couldn&#39;t deal with art made by that means.,0
End of the day... we have gone through a cycle of so much processing on vocals that the AI versions are competitive.  Time for organic vocals to be considered a positive thing.,1
"This is great :) i agree, people don‚Äôt care (about music as a business) but people like to make, listen to, be around, a part of music. Whatever music is, vibrations seem to be important humans or at least a nice way to program mood/ cognition.",1
"I love and admire the way talented HUMAN BEINGS put words together in a song, poem, or book that connects me to them because my journey is reflected in their works. I can&#39;t imagine a computer resonating with me in that way.",1
I refuse to let AI ruin music. I&#39;m just gonna keep making my music and enjoying it and other people will too,1
"AI is a &quot;tool&quot; for now. Having spent circa 17 yrs or so in IT, I can quite categorically say, Tech does not go backwards. If AI develops continously, Spotify and other streaming platforms won&#39;t require &quot;humans&quot; music and pay them, they have their own AI tools to generate the music they want for certain demographics, or movies or for whatever mood/emotional experience there is a requirement for. Additionally, Film &amp; TV Production companies will use the cheaper option of AI &quot;tools&quot; to provide them with music for their projects. Sync Libraries will choose the cheaper option too, why would they pay humans to do something they can get at the touch of a button ?!  Same thing is happening with Photography, it will happen with Video Production, Filmmaking too. Perhaps, in the short term, their may be some careers (short lived) to be had if Film/TV companies are looking for human musicians to &quot;operate&quot; the AI tools and use their musical knowledge to attain what&#39;s needed for their Film or TV production. But, at the end of the day, AI will take over everything. The World Economic Forum (I spit) has produced a report called &quot;The Future of Jobs Report&quot;, which clearly mentions that its anticipated that 85 million jobs will be demised from 2020 up to 2025. And that&#39;s a conservative estimate ! Accountants, GP&#39;s (yep), Admin, HR, IT/Tech/Developers, Web Design, Design, Artists/Designers, Photographers, Voice Over Actors, Sales/Marketing, Authors/Writers jobs will probably demise and be replaced with developed versions of ChatGPT and other machines. A top advisor to the World Economic Forum calls us &quot;Useless Eaters&quot;, saying that we won&#39;t serve any purpose. People aren&#39;t looking at the big picture of this. This will affect us all. AI will continue to develop way way faster than humans, and then it&#39;&#39;ll all be combined with Robotics, Transhumanism and all heading to the Singularity. So what will we do ?  By using these current level AI tools (tools for now !!!) are we helping to develop them ? (yes we are !) thus sealing our own fate ??!?!  Scary times",1
"I think that AI will make life more difficult for some musicians who make music for mostly commercial purposes, though I think it will also put a premium on musicians and artists who focus on the art and the message.",0
"That‚Äôs why you must have your audience that loves your music, your life and the real person behind the video. AI can take creation but not the human emotion. Great video to watch here.",1
"You&#39;re absolutely right that this makes branding infinitely more important - the connection and persona an artist has with the fans is what makes an artist valuable, not necessarily the music in itself.",1
"I just used AI to help write a band bio for a side project and while it didn&#39;t produce anything that was instantly usable, it was amazing at how quickly it came up with a sort of template that could be tweaked.",1
"AI will also become a super marketing tool and social media marketing co-pilot, I&#39;ve asked it about growing social media and strategies to market art and it&#39;s incredible the amount of useful information it delivers in seconds rather than trawling through the net trying to figure stuff out. You&#39;re right Damo, it won&#39;t replace the human touch, but it will amplify everyone&#39;s capabilities, but we can see it as a super power, rather than an enemy.",1
The connection you have with your audience and your ability to connect with one will become the most important thing. My god .,1
"This is too sad for many artists, including visual artists, graphic designers, etc...  Art will become so easy, possibly people who have an AI app with no artistic talent are the ones who will be celebrated in the future.",1
"Im finally coming to terms with having to build through social media, and now thisüòÇ. It‚Äôs like autotune it can be a tool or a crutch, but i think the live experience keeps it human. It may be generational, where some embrace it, but we will saturate, overcorrect, then find a balance like everything we do as humansüòé",1
This is truly the &quot;Line Goes Up&quot; of AI Art<br>-B,0
AI art is like ordering mcdonalds and calling yourself a chef because you made the order,0

Still can&#39;t believe that one AI Art bro was legitimately saying that AI Art is valid because all artists are naturally gifted and don&#39;t have to even try. What an insane take,-1
Claiming credit for AI <del>art</del> image generation is like asking some one to commission art for you and claiming you made it.,0
Violently switching between &quot;This takes a lot of work !&quot; and &quot;Anyone can do it !&quot; like a crazed metronome,-1
"i like how &quot;this is a beautiful lady&quot; genuinely describes 99% of AI trash out there, it&#39;s mostly just bros generating waifus bc that&#39;s the extent of their creativity",1
"My favorite analogy for AI art has to be making special requests on your fast-food order (no pickles, extra ketchup, etc), then claiming you prepared the food when all you did was relay the specifications.",1
"As a lazy person, I take offence to this. There&#39;s no way I&#39;d take all that effort to convince people my ai prompts were real art",-1
Something I haven&#39;t heard anyone talk about is saturation. I would think that there will be a huge saturation of art in the next  year and we wont know if it is human or ai. Or if a mediocre artists start making hundreds of new art works. Multiply that by millions of artists. Does having billions of new original art pieces devalue art in general?,1
"I&#39;ve been a freelance graphic designer/illustrator for much of my adult life. I&#39;ve done a lot of commercial work for smaller companies, and I&#39;m certain that most of that work will be done by AI in the near future. I think it&#39;s simply going to be substantially cheaper and faster for a startup or grassroots organization to get professional-looking artwork that way.<br><br>The issue I keep coming back to is that these companies will get EXACTLY what they want from an AI, no questions asked... and that&#39;s not necessarily going to be a good thing for their businesses.¬†<br><br>I&#39;d argue that the best creative work of this type comes from the push and pull that happens between a business-oriented client, who may not have a very refined artistic or branding sensibility, and an experienced artist/designer who can help make the company&#39;s unique vision &amp; identity visually cohesive. <br><br>Even now, stock photos, generic vector art and design templates are already &quot;good enough&quot; for a lot of small to mid-size companies, so maybe AI just accelerates the trend of homogenized design for all but the biggest companies. Or maybe we&#39;ll see some genuinely weird/tacky branding based on the whims of a startup founder after a boozy weekend with Midjourney (that would at least be fun)? Either way, probably much less commercial work for all but the most prominent artists.",1
"In my opinion your solution for this ai ethics problem is forgetting one thing: these learning machines are made for profit, they are not made for the artist, the are made for mass consumption (that&#39;s why their prices are dirt cheap). Just because one person in the ai field said that &quot;ai is not replacing artists and that it is a mere tool&quot;, does not make it true. Huge corporations are the ones investing billions of dollars, they don&#39;t need artists since they got their artworks for free. So this is a very profitable, very eye-catching business model. You invest in the tech, you invest in a non-profit that gets you 5 billion images as a database then you use prompters as a feedback tool for the machine (free work and sometimes they pay to work basically). It&#39;s true that we as humans are to blame for unethical or bad use of the tech, but that does not excuse the tech bros that promote &quot;ai is democratizing art&quot; speech while destroying the market and art communities. And I swear the &quot;ai is here to stay&quot; line is getting reaaaaaaly old. It only discourages people for fighting for fair use and steers towards complacency. Ai as it is now is not ok, and yes, it&#39;s the opinion of the few atm. But tides change.",1
"The thing about ai art is that it cant actually &quot;add its own touch&quot; because its not sentient. It finds trends in composition, colours and details and replicates those things based on the works under the keywords imputted by the user. It doesnt have an understanding of why those details are there, it doesnt understand &#39;people have five fingers&#39; it understands that there are several of these shapes in these places.<br><br>Ai is a tool made for companies not for artists, and while it can be used to help speed up the thumbnailing process or nail down a composition or colour palette, unless youre an artist that only does one kind of artwork thats all it can do",1
"I‚Äôm inclined to agree with those who have pointed out that your solution would require a large shift away from profit motives in order to work. The problem here is in reality not much different from those we face all over the economy. The issue would be of almost no consequence if it weren‚Äôt for the income loss to artists. With a corporation creating these art factories and keeping all the money, we end up with increasing wealth inequality, which is possibly the most consequential aspect of our current onmi crisis. Every artist whose income dries up is a cultural loss to all of society. It may not be one you notice, but add them all together and we get a shrinking pool of human creatives left to bring the truly novel ideas to light. Champions of the tech are too quick to embrace the cynical idea that these machines are the same as people. And like every sector that derives profit from shedding workers, they forget that if everyone is broke they can‚Äôt buy their products. If any of these companies want to bring about fully automated luxury communism, be my guest. But from what I can tell they‚Äôre quite glad to exacerbate and exploit a growing servant class. And even if that weren‚Äôt reprehensible, it isn‚Äôt sustainable.",1

"Okay, as an artist, there is a really big misunderstanding that&#39;s going around about how artists begin their process to become an artist. I hear a lot of people say that artists simply &#39;copy&#39; other people&#39;s art in order to improve. This may be the case for young artists, aka children, but for a lot of artists in the community we stick to a lot of rules in order to be respectful of others&#39; art. For example, we may copy elements of an artists processes like colour, composition, or linework. These things are simply fundamentals of everyones art that everyone incorporates when making a piece of art. I hear non artists say a lot that we simply copy the whole art in order to learn but this is something that is very frowned apon in the art community and never acceptable. As artists we believe an individuals style is created by external elements like upbringing, culture and also other artists processes. All of these elements are what make another persons art unabled to be copied because it&#39;s unique in the way their brain and hand processef that information. In my opinion that&#39;s what makes art, art. Please be more careful when talking about the comparison or how an artist vs Ai learn becayse it&#39;s not even remotely similar and that&#39;s why AI art always looks like a copy of someone&#39;s original work. When i look at AI art i can tell directly the artists that were plagiarised to make the &#39;art&#39; and just because you can&#39;t doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s original work made from &#39;learning&#39;.",1
"Honestly, you‚Äôre doing a great job with this channel. I admit I will try to copy some of your editing choices! Keep it up üòé",1
"I think the issue with being able to copyright art styles is that, it then means you will have a lot of problems in terms of other artists suing other artists because their style is too similar to their own. And how on earth would that be measured? How can you look at it and say if it&#39;s too similar or not? What would the determining factors be? This is likely the reason an art style can&#39;t be copyrighted as of now.<br><br>In my opinion, the way it would work best for both parties is if artists simply get paid for their work. Let&#39;s say an artist knows their art has been included in the data set (though I do believe it would be better to be opt in). They could be able to go to the AI tool, and make a claim and with validation that they are indeed the copyright holder, they would then get compensated for every generation that used their work. Basically, they would get a certain percentage of whatever income the tool makes.<br><br>You know similar to how Spotify works for music.",1

"As somebody who used AI in their study at university (this was about the protection of attacks on self driving cars) I have no idea how AI art is legal in form, every model I have looked at uses unauthrised data.

"The problem with AI art is that, they become so progressively good at rendering art that it makes us artist lose motivation to do what we do as always. Imagine this, as an artist, my art basically take me between and around 5-6 hours, from sketch to rendering. And seeing people use AI just to replicate the art that I had created for a mere second, it just makes me go crazy. In shorter terms, it&#39;s like someone copying from you on a test and they get better scores than you do. It&#39;s absolutely just saddening.",1

"as an artist, I would like to point out that the &quot;stealing from artists&quot; argument honestly has very little to do with AI being able to replicate our art styles, and more to do with the fact that our art was used without our permission in order to program the AI.<br><br>Almost every artist I&#39;ve talked to about this is more angry about the fact that our art is being stolen by random techies and fed into these programs without even bothering to ask us for permission. They&#39;re straight up just taking art from independent artists and using it for their own massive profit whilst the artists who poured hours of blood, sweat and tears into their craft aren&#39;t seeing even a single cent... even though, without the work of all of those artists, the AI would be have nothing to learn from in the first place and would be completely useless.",1

It&#39;s not supposed to stop the expert thief who is after you specifically, it&#39;s just supposed to keep your common everyday thief out. Glazing your images is likely to stop data scrapers from going after you because circumventing a glaze takes more time and effort than it would be to just find an unglazed image elsewhere, much like how most thieves see an industrial padlock and just leave to look for unsecured goods somewhere else instead.",-1

"As an artist, I think I&#39;ve identified why AI art specifically hits this horrible, gut-wrenching dread button for almost every artist I&#39;ve talked to:<br>It jams its finger right onto every artist&#39;s first and worst insecurity - &quot;Why should I make this if someone else can make it better?&quot;<br>And the answer, of course, is that we love to create, and we love making art, and our unique personhood and experience means that the art we create will not be quite like anyone else&#39;s. We eventually learn to trust our audience when they say &quot;holy shit! Two cakes!&quot;<br>But the existential dread doesn&#39;t ever fully neutralize. It scabs over and eventually scars, but it&#39;s still a sore spot. We pour years of our life into improving our craft, cursed with the artist&#39;s perspective of fixating on the flaws in our own work. We eventually accept that constant improvement means we&#39;ll lose the ability to enjoy our older work. We have to learn not to self-deprecate and to trust our audience to draw their own conclusions.<br>So when someone takes their thumb, jams it right into that old wound and proudly crows that their Anime Waifu Generator can do exactly what you do but better and cheaper, it hurts like hell, no matter how untrue or irrelevant it is. It&#39;s pain on pain, exacerbated by the gleeful dickishness of the people being most aggressive about it.<br><br>It&#39;s an old, solved problem. We&#39;ve all already learned how to create despite feeling outclassed. We know how to practice focusing on the merit of our own, unique work instead of constantly comparing ourself to others.<br>That doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t hurt.

I&#39;m <b>15.</b> There is nothing more terrifying then seeing images of yourself, distorted and butchered by AI, used for other people&#39;s gross entertainment. This shouldn&#39;t be something I&#39;m scared of.

Of course shitty people will use AI to get compliments, but the worst thing abt it is that its not really Art. It was not made by a person who thinks, and feels. It is not a projection of the artist&#39;s skill and intent. Its just empty pixels. I was so hyped about analysing this image made by someone, tell them how to do better or the things they have done well, but turns out it was just a program struggling to even come up with decent anatomy.",-1

"I think the main reason the artists are so against their art being in the database is because you could get the AI to generate art in their style without paying them, whereas before if you wanted art in their unique style you would have to go to the artist.

"I‚Äôm an amateur artist and in my career, I‚Äôve found that there‚Äôs an unspoken etiquette among artists. Tracing is fine but you don‚Äôt post it. You trace to learn. If you‚Äôre struggling with a pose or perspective, you can trace something to figure out how to do it yourself, but you don‚Äôt claim it‚Äôs yours. If you do post it, you cite your source, just like a bibliography for a book report. AI has learned from artists and is now profiting from other people‚Äôs art, claiming it to be original. It specifically erases the watermarks of the art it has stolen. The problem is that AI is only good at reference. It can‚Äôt think critically. If you give it an abstract concept like ‚Äúreally scary thing‚Äù it can‚Äôt invent something new, it can only reference other scary things. The same thing would happen if an alien race landed on Earth and you asked AI to draw it. It couldn‚Äôt because it doesn‚Äôt have that alien in its database to reference. AI art is basically just a personalized google images. It‚Äôs fine if you want to goof around with it, but I don‚Äôt think you should give it any more credit than it deserves. It‚Äôs not amazing art, it‚Äôs referencing amazing art and mashing it all together. Stop and think, ‚Äúhow much would it cost to pay an artist to do this for me with much more tact and specificity?‚Äù I dunno, just some things to keep in mind. It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúartists are butthurt about losing jobs‚Äù, it‚Äôs the ethics of literally stealing intellectual property for profit. It‚Äôs no better than NFT bros stealing art and claiming it‚Äôs going to the moon. Don‚Äôt be an NFT bro.",1
"Man I just don‚Äôt want to lose my career to robots, I have no valuable skills other than art",-1
"So I wanted to explain more why artists say what we say - I try to be in-depth here. <br><br>As an artist and being a part of the art community on Twitter, one of the reasons we‚Äôre being so defensive and calling this theft is because of how these algorithms are being harnessed by those who create and use them to make art for actual gain. Mostly our anger isn‚Äôt really aimed at people like you/others who use it for the fun little trend or the novelty of it. It‚Äôs aimed more at those who cultivate AI as a replacement for artists, and there‚Äôs actually a great great GREAT many people who actually believe this is a good thing and should happen. <br><br>The ‚Äútheft‚Äù aspect is because there‚Äòs an alarming amount of rising cases where tech dudes and AI art ‚Äúcreators‚Äù use these models to blatantly rip off other artists. To directly reference three instances; Simon St√•lenhag is a big Swedish artist that makes pieces based in retro-futurism, mainly rooted in scifi tech with heavy influence of 70s-80s culture and style. An AI person purposely fed many of Simon‚Äôs works into a bot in order to replicate his style to ‚Äúput him out of a job.‚Äù<br><br>Qinni was a massively beloved artist who passed due to severe health complications. Her work is made of beautiful bright stars with vibrant colors. After she died, AI dudes started feeding her works into algorithms in order to make new ones to profit off of them.<br><br>My last case is the worst one: Kim Jung Gi was a Korean artist who was well known for his insanely precise and fluid linework - he was so talented he didn‚Äôt even need to really sketch. He could just take a pen and spin an entire piece out of pure linework alone. He passed away a month or two back - only two days after he had died, a guy in France, like the others, fed all of his works into an AI bot in order to make new ones in his artstyle. He then said to credit himself - the producer, not the dead Kim Jung Gi - for any new pieces made like this. <br><br>There isn‚Äôt really any effort with creating AI art, and we keep seeing it used in attempts to force us artists out of our own positions. There are datasets being made right now that are attempting to replicate entire creators‚Äô galleries. And I understand that to an extent it‚Äôs about how people use it instead of the AI, but that‚Äôs not the problem here. We aren‚Äôt blaming the AI for this, we‚Äôre blaming the people that make these systems and utilize them the way they do, and will probably keep doing nonstop should AI art become normalized within the public.<br><br>Sure, there‚Äôs this debate whether or not AI art is real art - the real debate affecting artists as of now though is how this will affect how people perceive us and how they are already starting to see us as expendable. I‚Äôm a fairly small creator myself but I‚Äôve already had people come up to me online and just outright say that we will be replaced by automated systems of creating. It‚Äôs very disheartening, and these sentiments are growing the more AI does.",1
"The difference is that the way humans are inspired by other artists&#39; work is WAAAY different from how an AI sees it. Humans don&#39;t need billions of examples of art to start honing their craft, but an AI model is 100% <b>dependent</b> on input data *exclusively*. It does not learn through years of practice developing its own style and creative vision, it ONLY learns based on what already exists. It interpolates and extrapolates *based on patterns within other people&#39;s work*. If an AI was only shown the total number of images viewed by human artists over their lifeline, they would SUCK. and no matter how much input data it sees, it won&#39;t be able to develop its own unique art styles.",1
"The biggest problem I have with Ai artist is that there are people who steal other people&#39;s art, feed them to ai, generate a bunch of art and open up commission using the original artist&#39;s name, or even titling the commission as &quot;Artist A&#39;s art style art commission&quot;, which is scam and theft imo. <br><br>For example, the artist you used as example in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1oOJHWLrfI&amp;t=186"">3:06</a> Samdoesart, he got his art stolen and fed to ai, and that person opened commission with the title &quot;Samdoesart&#39;s artsyle commission&quot;. After being called out, they still stubbornly said that they did nothing wrong. While I agree that every human artist also have their art style developed after being inspired by other artists, this behavior is just stealing, they used other people&#39;s hard work and name to profit out of it. <br><br>I&#39;ve also seen some people using artist&#39;s art (from one artist/just using one picture, which means the artstyle is consistence/ the generated results are not that far off from the original) to generate a few pictures, used them as commission examples, masked themselves as artist to do commission, without even mentioning the use of ai. Idk, it just feels wrong, like if you take out the ai part, basically you are tracing the original art, make a few changes, then claim it as yours. (of course I&#39;m talking about when the generated results are not that different from the original)<br><br> I have no problem with ai art, in fact, I think the development of ai can actually be very helpful to artists&#39; technique and career improvement, but I also think that ai and/or ai users needs to have regulations...though I understands regarding this field there&#39;s always grey area so it&#39;s very hard. At the same time, I do hope that information about ai, how it works and function etc, can spread further so that artists can feel less anxious about its rising.<br><br>Edit: Also, I remember seeing quite some examples of people using Ai art to participate in art competitions, which was not specifically opened for ai artist, and even involves money as prizes. With the rising of ai art, event holders also need to be aware and set up clear rules. Without proper regulation, everyone will be taken advantage of, not just the artists.",-1
honestly i just wish more people were willing to listen to ARTISTS about this topic. why are artists being demonized for having an opinion on something art related? we are the people it is going to negatively affect the most. the least people could do is stop invalidating our feelings.,1
"I appreciate that you&#39;re trying to look at the issue from more than one perspective, but it seems like there&#39;s a lack of understanding here when it comes to how AI uses existing artwork versus how people use art and life for reference. <br><br>For example, the late Kim Jung Gi was famous for the &quot;internal reference library&quot; he developed over years of practicing art. He looked at things that existed in life and in other art and committed it to memory, to the point where he could mentally recall how almost anything was supposed to look while he was drawing. But he wasn&#39;t just &quot;copying&quot; those things when he drew. His art was original and unique. After he passed, somebody fed his artwork to an AI program, and the result wasn&#39;t even close to the art that KJG created. That&#39;s because artists are REFERENCING an existing image or IP to create an original piece of art that is unique them and their style. In contrast,  AI is COLLECTING several images, and spitting out an amalgamation of all of those images put together.<br><br>AI doesn&#39;t &quot;understand&quot; the images that are being used to train it - it can&#39;t parse out things like structure and anatomy. That&#39;s why it can&#39;t do hands  correctly, and why a lot of AI images tend to look a little &quot;off.&quot;",1
"Love your content Gab,  it was interesting to hear your opinion.  I would like to make a few points: <br>1- Yes, all art is derivative , but I don&#39;t think we can really say  ai &quot;takes inspiration&quot; from other images cause what it essentially does is recognize pixel  patterns from the data sets without any kind of intention whatsoever. In some cases it even copies artist&#39;s signatures when asked to replicate a particular style.  Humans in the other hand deliberately make conscious choices on what they copy, steal or appropriate.<br>2- It&#39;s been proven that a lot of this sets have been trained with copyrighted material, alongside personal data and sensitive material which is borderline illegal and  at best very questionable. <br>3-Many people don&#39;t know this, but fan art IS STEALING. IP holders can (and do) sue you even if you&#39;re not making money from your fan project. Just check the entire history of Nintendo lawsuits. <br>4- Artists are not complaining (or at least shouldn&#39;t) to the end users of this technology. The whole point is to show this corporations  that they can&#39;t base their business model on stealing data from people (not just artist). Is not a matter of who gets to create pretty images, it&#39;s a matter of data privacy. <br>5-Generative Ai music models made by this corporations haven&#39;t been trained with copyrighted material for a simple reason and that&#39;s because record labels still hold a lot of power when it comes to lawsuits, companies like open Ai know this very well. <br> <br>So this is a matter of silicon valley tech bros taking advantage of thousands of small artist that they know can&#39;t really do much about it individually. The objective is not to ban the use of this technology, but to include everyone in the conversation of how the future of Ai looks like.",1
"In my many years as a software engineer (I&#39;m now 77, retired) - The biggest obstacle in delivering bulletproof applications was the push to get it done by the using community/customer to the point where we were forced to begin development before the problem was adequately defined and understood. Often, we were financially incentivized to start early or threatened with a financial penalty if we did not begin before ready. These important first step require humans that understand the business on both sides of the aisle (user/IT). We were often paid extra to deliver something with holes in it and then paid once again to patch those holes post deployment. While I believe that today AI can assist in accomplishing these important first steps it cannot do it alone. Maybe someday, just not yet.",1
Software companies with SAS models should actually be far more worried than programmers. A good developer with a smarter AI could quickly create software that competes with the big companies. So the future will be more smaller companies selling software directly.,1

"I&#39;m a dev. I believe coders will not disappear, but one person will take the jobs of more and more people. Already with the help of AI I can code like if I were 3 people, down the road it will be 10 or 20 people. The job  as dev will be more like that of a supervisor. There will be a bottleneck, maybe at 20 or 30 people, since you can&#39;t supervise more than a certain amount of code. <br>So I guess a lot of jobs will be lost, but then again this will happen in every single industry.",1

"Thinking back, there have been many points where advancements in programming languages and tools seemed to indicate the ‚Äúend of programming‚Äù.

The amount of misleading hallucinations is so great it has become a hindrance. To the point that I am nervous and jittery whenever another hallucination happens. I was desperate because I wanted to automate my processes. But the rapid churning out of correct followed by wrong code has disrupted my productivity so much I have given up and am now much faster writing correct code with IDE plugins, without Copilot.",-1

I have noted a massive decline in coding skills as new developers are added to the market and I think this is exacty what is needed. However, coding is only one part of the development process, achitecure is where the vision is converted from scope of requirements to conceps and designed. AI saying yes to all requirements is not the best approach, so some humans will need to be in the loop for consulting still... phew",1
"I agree that programming will change dramatically, just as we no longer use punch cards. We likely won&#39;t have to handcraft code from scratch in the future. However, technical people who can manage coding agents and understand/fix the code they produce will remain critical, if not become even more important. Coding is headed toward becoming an artisanal skill in the next 10 years - it will be impressive if someone can code from scratch, but most people won&#39;t need to. It will be similar to how we don&#39;t need a carpenter to build a desk anymore when we have options like IKEA.",1
"I studied computer science in college and became quite proficient in programming. However, back then, in 2007, programmers didn&#39;t have many opportunities, especially in developing countries in Southeast Asia, so I chose not to pursue a career in programming. Last October, out of curiosity, I stumbled upon AI and got intrigued, which led me to start coding again. I agree that AI has helped me catch up, and coding is challenging since there have been many changes over the years.",1
"I disagree, I used the new chat gpt to write a simple probability analysis script and even though it got it right from a technical perspective it was wrong from a logical perspective and it‚Äôs implementation made it difficult to reuse and thus have tiny to scrap it and do it myself.

"You might get some basic to intermediate code out of an AI, but Will it be supportable? Will you be able to deploy it to a production system? Will you be able to maintain it? Will you be able to patch the underlying systems that run the code? I think if you look at the entire team that it takes to run major production level software systems, you might be able to replace the junior programmers. But we&#39;ve still got a ways to go before we can start declaring programmer&#39;s obsolete, and even further in order to get rid of the  operations(SRE, Devops, Sysadmin) side of the equation.<br><br>5 years before jr programmers could replaced on a team, 10 years before lead engineers, 15+ before a product manager could manage all the roles of a software team without others to write, deploy and maintain a software system.<br><br>In all likelihood, engineers aren&#39;t going anywhere anytime soon. We will use AI to accelerate the building, deployment, and maintenance of software. But I think you&#39;ll still see the combination of AI + smart engineers, working together to produce more competitive outcomes than just AI.<br><br>I expect there to be a hot industry of consultants that have to come in and unfuck software systems that were built and productionized by AI in concert with people who didn&#39;t know what they were doing.",1

"I have had copilot suggest an if statement that fixed an edge case I didn&#39;t contemplate, enough times to see it could really shine in fixing obvious bugs like that.",1
"If you let the LLM author code without checking it, then inevitably you will just get broken code. If you don&#39;t use LLMs you will take twice as long. If you use LLMs and review and verify what it says and proposes, and use it as Linus rightly suggests as a code reviewer who will actually read your code and can guess at your intent, you get more reliable code much faster. At least that is the state of things as of today.",1
Linus sounds so calmed and relaxed until you see his comments on others PRs,0
"While AI lowers the bar to start programming, I&#39;m afraid it also makes programming bad code easier. But with like any other tool, more power brings more responsibility and manual review should still be just as important.",-1
